# Peripatos 2024—Statement of Purpose & Overview

— Amy Hackney Blackwell & Christopher Blackwell

> **περίπᾰτ-ος**. περίπατος, ὁ. (*peripatos*) [among other meanings] “discourse during a walk, discussion, argument”, Ar. *Ra.* 942, Bato 2.3; π. περί τινος Ar. *Ra.* 953; ἑωθινὸς π., δειλινὸς π., Aristotleʼs names for his morning and evening lectures, Gell. 20.5.5.

This is the story of a sabbatical trip. We posted a [statement of purpose, of sorts,](https://eumaeus.substack.com/p/coming-soon) beforehand. This is the after-action report!

A [sabbatical (from the Greek adjective Σαββατικός, ή, όν)](http://folio2.furman.edu/lsj/?urn=urn:cite2:hmt:lsj.chicago_md:n92990) is meant to be a break. The word itself is related to "sabbath," the seventh day of the week dedicated to resting from labors. University faculty receive the incredible gift of time off every seventh year, a break intended to let them rest, reflect, and then resume their professions with renewed vigor and interest. It's a time for research, for pondering the deep problems of the field, and for updated education.

The two of us had the great good fortune to be able to spend two months in Greece in September and October of 2024. The stars aligned in every possible way—Chris had a sabbatical, the kids were grown, our son's wedding wasn't until December, we were both still young enough and fit enough to pull off a lengthy and physically challenging journey. There was funding and Greece is cheap. We get along. Chris can drive a stick shift. All the pieces were there.

But for a trip to qualify as a sabbatical journey, you can't just say "I think it would be fun to go to Greece!" Which might be true, but isn't "improving". 

So we put together an itinerary designed to make Chris a better classicist and to create a body of material that he could use to make students better classists as well. That the trip turned out to also be incredibly fun was hardly beside the point—reading Greek is a luxury, and so it should be a pleasure!

Here's how we did it.

## Ground-Truth

> "We'll start today," said Caesar firmly. "It's—what? Forty miles from here? We won't do it in one ride."
>
> "We'll go by ship," said the King, who loathed traveling.
>
> "No, we'll go overland. I like to get the feel of terrain. Gaius Marius—who was my uncle by marriage—told me I should always journey by land if possible. Then if in future I should campaign there, I would know the lie of the land. Very useful."
>
> — [Colleen McCullough, **Fortune's Favorites**](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B081CZ9LVY?ref_=dbs_m_mng_rwt_calw_tkin_2&storeType=ebooks&qid=1733506451&sr=8-1)

This quotation, from one of the best historical treatments of the Roman Republic ever written, might not be an actual transcript of a conversation between Gaius Julius Caesar and King Nicomedes of Bithynia. No matter. It might as well be, and it sums up the philosophy of our trip.

Travel today is insulated. Airplanes let us cover vast distances with no notion of the terrain below us. The Deluxe Motorcoach whisks tourists from site to site far above the surface of the road in a climate-controlled bubble. Even many shoes have such thick, stiff soles it's impossible to feel the shape of the ground. 

But geography is destiny, history is geography, and it's impossible to fully understand ancient life if you have no notion of what that life was like on the ground. Greece is a steep and abrupt country. Mountains rise to block you most of the time. If it's not mountains, it's water. Paths are rocky and lined with a variety of very spiky plants. 

Historians describe ancient journeys in a few words. "The 300 Spartans, led by King Leonidas, marched from Sparta to Thermopylae to confront the Persians." All well and good, until you consider what that might have involved.

![The easy way to get to Thermopylae](images/Thermopylae_motorcoach_IMG_2012.jpg)

Sparta is NOT CLOSE to Thermopylae. If you were to drive it today using the fastest route through the Isthmus of Corinth, it would take the better part of a day. And what you might well not notice on that drive is all the mountains. 

![So. Many. Mountains! (Ancient Sparta)](images/Sparta_mountains_IMG_2414.jpg)

It seems likely that Leonidas led his crew the way we drove back to Athens from Sparti, through the broad plain of eternal summer in the central Pelopponese, perhaps past Nauplion, through the Isthmus, past Athens and to the route of the current A1, which would take them to the Hot Gates, perhaps with a stop at what is now the beachfront town of Kamena Vourla. On foot, carrying armor and weapons and several weeks' worth of food, this would have taken many days. 

![This actually **is** Sparta!](images/Sparta_Leonidas_IMG_2423.jpg)

Even for the toughest guys in the world, the so-called "goat path" must've been a challenge for Xerxes’ army as it outflanked Leonidas’ 300 Spartans.

![We think the goat path might have been up there.](images/Thermopylae_goat_path_IMG_2016.jpg)

![It might have been something like this.](images/cliff-walk-480.mov)

We wanted to get at least an inkling of what it all was like. So we planned to travel with as little insulation as possible between us and the land and sea. If we could walk, we would walk. Otherwise, we drove ourselves. If we had to cross water, we did it on boats. No airplanes once we arrived in Greece, and no Deluxe Motorcoaches. We weren't quite returning to the 18th century, but at times it felt like we'd at least returned to the 1950s.

## Walking and Talking

We talk all the time. It's been the foundation of our relationship since we were in separate grad schools and talked on the phone for hours every night. It was expensive back then.

We talk about anything. We whiled away the descent into [Samaria Gorge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samaria_Gorge) discussing the relative manliness of [Cormoran Strike](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cormoran+strike+series&crid=C2UXJ33CFI3R&sprefix=cormoran%2Caps%2C175&ref=nb_sb_ss_ts-doa-p_1_8) and [Jack Reacher](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=jack+reacher+books+in+sequence+1-27&crid=2P7AMBXZRZ0RB&sprefix=jack+reacher+books%2Caps%2C179&ref=nb_sb_ss_ts-doa-p_2_18), much to the amusement of the Wisconsin couple struggling along behind us.

To capture the talking while we were walking, we took about a million pictures with our iPhones, and captured video, both handheld and by drone.

## Terms of Travel

To maximize walking time, we scheduled several multi-day self-guided hikes through [Trekking Hellas](https://trekking.gr/en). Trekking Hellas is the biggest and oldest adventure travel company in Greece. We'd used their services in 2023 to book a hike over Mt. Parnassos and down through Delphi and were very happy with them.

Self-guided trekking works like this: Trekking Hellas books us into hotels on designated days. They provide us route cards and GPX tracks that we can use for navigation. At the beginning of each week of hiking, we would meet with one of their representatives for a discussion of the hike. Otherwise they left us alone. Every morning, we dropped off our suitcases at the front desk of the hotel where we spent the night. After breakfast, we walked off toward our next destination. While we walked, someone put our bags in a car and drove them to the day's destination, where they awaited our arrival that afternoon.

The provided GPX files outlining the trails for each day were really valuable. Unlike our ancient predecessors, we have not grown up walking those hills. We recommend the [GaiaGPS](https://www.gaiagps.com/map/?loc=8.0/22.3310/37.3876) app and website, by the way, for navigation. It works great, even offline (which is valuable when you're paying for international data roaming and often don't even have signal to pay for).

It's a great system, and it means we can hike with light packs. Many days we carry only water, phones, and maybe sunscreen. We've never had a problem with items going missing, even when we pack computers in our bags.

In between treks, we stayed in AirB&Bs or with friends. My requirements for rentals included at least two bedrooms (staying in hotel rooms half the time provides sufficient togetherness), a washing machine (you will find no dryer in Greece), and a kitchen. We had some amazingly comfortable rentals for shockingly low prices.

![Clothes dry fast in the wind, but you want to grab them before the rain starts.](images/Kamena_laundry_drying_IMG_1997-480.mov)

We also needed a parking space if we expected to have a rental car.

![We had to back down an alley to park in Nafplio.](images/Nafplio_parking_space_IMG_2430.jpg)

Most of our rentals came with cats, *gratis*.

![This cat glides like a ghost on the tops of whitewashed walls.](images/Santorini_house_cat_IMG_3158.jpg)

![We bought Friskies for our Kavousi cats at the Sklavenitis grocery store in Agios Nikolaus.](images/Kavousi_Amy_cat_2.jpg)

Two nights we slept on ferries travelling to and among the islands of the Aegean. Ferry cabins are an amazing deal, combining accommodation and travel for two in one price and in facilities that are infinitely more comfortable than airports and airplanes: Wifi, coffee shops, bars, white-tablecloth restaurants, en-suite bathrooms with showers! 

![A cabin on a Blue Star Ferry.](images/blue-star-ferries-cabin.jpg)

Our itinerary was designed to cover as much of the modern nation-state of Greece as possible while also avoiding Athens. We started in the north in early September, and chased the summer down into Crete, where we could still swim in late October.

## Northern Greece

We'd initially thought the northern Greece section would include a focus on Macedonia and Alexander the Great as well as Mount Olympus. When we learned that our Greek-American friends would be staying at their home in Gavalou, however, we happily ditched those topics in favor of a weekend of local Greek life. (For what it's worth, simply driving the A2 east to west across northern Greece is in itself a moderate exploration of Macedonia, Epirus, and Molossia; it would not have been trivial *at all* for Alexander's mom Olympias to travel from Molossia to Pella for her wedding!)

We began by flying into [Thessaloniki](https://eumaeus.substack.com/publish/posts/detail/148843598?referrer=%2Fpublish%2Fposts). After a couple of nights in an apartment to recover from jet lag, we drove to [Gavalou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavalou), where we enjoyed endless local hospitality and local folk-dancing and folk-singing festivals.

![Gavalou gets uncharacteristically busy at festival time.](images/Gavalou_IMG_1056.jpg)

When our friends left the village to head back to Athens and home, we had a day to spare before beginning our first hike, so headed back north to spend a night in [Meteora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteora). 

![Meteora really is spectacular!](images/Meteora_IMG_1638.jpg)

From Meteora, we drove across Thessaly to Magnesia and the Pelion peninusula, where we did the [Mount Pelion hike](https://eumaeus.substack.com/p/hiking-pelion).

We spent our last few days up north in [Kamena Vourla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamena_Vourla), where we had a great view of the Malian Gulf, Euboiea, and the landscapes of both the battles of Artemesia and Thermopylae. 

![A hard-working boat in Kamena Vourla.](images/kv-boat.jpg)

And that was northern Greece!

## Pelopponese

It was on to the large southern part of Greece, which I suppose is technically an island if you count the (narrow, shallow, economically inconsequential) 19th-century canal across the isthmus of Corinth. We drove south across the plateau that contains Mount Parnassus and past Delphi, along the southern coast of Central Greece, and crossed the bridge at Patras to reach the Peloponnese.

![Arcadia looks like this.](images/Dimitsana_view_IMG_2168.jpg)

From there, we plunged south straight into the mountains, where we embedded ourselves in the wilds of Arcadia for a week by hiking [the Menalon Trail]().

We emerged into Sparti and Mystras, where we spent a couple of days visiting a Byzantine fortress and the ancient city of Sparta. This was a chance to see in person the natural defenses surrounding the fertile plain where Sparta was located, and to feel grateful that we hadn't signed on to do the (high and steep) Mount Tageytus trek as well.

![The Byzantine fortress of Mystras, above the plain of Sparti.](images/byzantine-church-orbit-480.mov)

We finished with a weekend in Nafplio, a chance to visit Argos and Mycenae. 

![The Venetian fortress in Nafplio.](images/nafplio-fortress.jpg)

![Taking a break at the lion gate.](images/Mycenae_lion_gate_IMG_2486.jpg)

Our last day in mainland Greece, we drove through the Isthmus back to Athens by way of Epidauros, noting the sites of Theseus's journey along the way. (We were avoiding Athens, but it turned out to be impossible to avoid it completely; the rental car had to go back to the airport.)

On the last evening of September, we boarded a [Blue Star](https://www.bluestarferries.com/en-gb?gSC=Usa_search&gad_source=1&gbraid=0AAAAADrMg7ty26FtnWdTQvA7czKj-TVPc&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIwbDJvq2YigMVOC3UAR0a-Q9MEAAYASAAEgK7iPD_BwE) ferry in Piraeus. We disembarked in a new month and a new region. 

![Sailing from Piraeus. The astonishing clouds are smoke from wildfires on the Isthmus.](images/Piraeus_ferry_clouds_IMG_2587.jpg)

## Aegean

October first found us sailing past the coast of Turkey on our way to Rhodes at the far eastern end of the Aegean. 

![Watching Turkey go by.](images/Turkey_coast_IMG_2619.jpg)

There, we encountered historical traces left on the landscape by ancient Greeks and Romans, the Knights Templar, and even the Italians who occupied the island in the early 20th century.

![In the Old Town.](images/Rhodes_OldTown_church_IMG_3091.jpg)

Local Trekking Hellas reps collected us in Rhodes City and transported us to [Embonas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embonas), there to begin our [Trekking Rhodes](https://trekking.gr/en/excursions/hiking-rhodes-self-guided) excursion. We learned that Embonas is known far and wide for its wonderful food and local wine.

![On Profitis Ilias, we visited two hotels frequented by Mussolini during the Italian occupation.](images/Rhodes_ProfitisIlias_IMG_2706.jpg)

![On Attaviros, we encountered a high wind farm near an army installation.](images/Rhodes_windmills_IMG_2734.jpg)

On Akramitis, we could see the full extent of the outer Aegean—east to Cyprus, west to the Aegean islands and Greece, southwest to Karpathos and Crete.

![Up and over Akramitis, on Rhodes.](images/rising-cliff-480.mov)

In Lindos, we saw our first white Cycladic town absolutely mobbed with tourists.

![The line to get into the Acropolis of Lindos. Some people ride donkeys up and down.](images/Lindos_line_tourist_donkeys_IMG_2974.jpg)

We finished our stay in Rhodos with three nights at a house in Kritika, a suburb of Rhodes City settled 100 years ago by Muslim refugees from Crete. 

![Our house in Rhodos](images/Kritika_house_IMG_3063.jpg)

We explored the modern city ([H&M in Rhodes City](https://www2.hm.com/el_gr/index.html) is a great place restock a wardrobe!) and watched *The Guns of Navarone*, now that we could appreciate the geography of eastern Rhodos. We even drove the entire circumference of the island in our rental car just so we could revisit our beloved southwestern region.

From Rhodes, we took a ferry back to Athens and then another one south to Santorini, where we explored the volcanic landscape. Verdict: geography amazing, culture awful, traffic likely impossible and impassible in August. 

![Santorini, looking past houses into the volcanic caldera.](images/santorini.jpg)

And that was the eastern Aegean. It was mid-October—time for our last stage: Crete.

## Crete

What to say about Crete? Is is Greece? Is it its own place? More to the point, is it still its own place now that half the population is tourists?

![The long, skinny island of Crete.](images/crete-sat.jpg)

Those questions are unanswerable, but it is certain that Crete is a place with tremendous history still visible on the land and that the landscape itself provides ample scope for challenging exploration.

We got there by taking an afternoon ferry from Santorini to Rethymno, on which we were entertained by a musical ensemble of ferry staff playing traditional Greek instruments. 

![The multi-talented crew of the JetStar ferry!](images/music-ferry-480.mov)

We were collected by Kyriakis, our Welcome Pickups driver, who gave us multiple tips about what to do and eat in Chania and western Crete. We carried out each one of his suggestions and were glad we did.

![The first suggestion we took was to get souvlaki at Syntrophia in Chania. These were the "small" portions.](images/Chania_souvlaki_IMG_3407.jpg)

From sunny, beachy Chania, we traveled to Omalos in the center of the [White Mountains](https://trekking.gr/en/excursions/hiking-in-the-white-mountains-of-crete-self-guided), once again finding ourselves in autumn. We hiked up a mountain and through two gorges.

![Amy on Mt. Gigilos.](images/giglios.jpg)

The Samaria Gorge spit us out on the south coast, where we discovered that most transportation is by water.

![People who do the Samaria Gorge as a day trip have to catch this ferry at 5 pm.](images/Agia_Roumeli_ferry_IMG_3718.jpg)

![Hiking above the Libyan Sea turned out to be hot, dusty, sunbaked, and occasionally terrifying.](images/SouthernCrete_trail_IMG_3891.jpg)

Having walked east, we sailed back west past familiar terrain and on past to Sougia, where we were joined by Yannis, our first and only Trekking Hellas guide. He shepherded us through our last [coastal treks](https://trekking.gr/en/excursions/coastal-treks-in-crete-e4): through an ancient asclepion, past high-altitude lammergeier ossuaries, and down to the pink sand of Elafonisi. 

![Yannis and Amy on the way to Elafonisi.](images/IMG_3602.jpg)

We collected our last rental car in Chania and drove back east to the town of Kavousi. There we spent our last week in a lovely stone house. 

![In Kavousi, we shared the parking lot next to the apothiki of the 1990s excavations.](images/Kavousi_parking_space_IMG_4222.jpg)

We used Kavousi as a base to visit old favorites—the Kastro and Tholos Beach—as well as new sites such as the Cave of Zeus and Kato Zakros. 

![The Minoans of Kato Zakros buried their dead in caves on the sides of this gorge.](images/KatoZakros_Gorge_IMG_4410-480.mov)

We spent an evening in Ierapetra, where we hooked up with Amy's old friend Manolis. 

![We also bought a wedding veil!](images/Ierapetra_veil_IMG_4377.jpg)

And that was that. 

## Conclusion

I think we both have more to think about, and maybe more to say, about the ancient world now that we've walked over a little bit of the landscape, away from the massive city of Athens. Collecting eggs with Manolis in Rhodes, watching the old dudes whack their walnut trees at harvest time, being surrounded by a flock of goats on a hillside, meeting candidates from five different political parties at a small-town taverna, being scared half to death on a narrow mountain pass along a cliff high above the sea… these experiences were priceless and we hope that they will be useful. We have every intention of coming back and doing more of this. In the meantime, there is lots more to say, and lots more pictures and videos to share!
