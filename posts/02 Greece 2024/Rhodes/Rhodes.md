# Rhodes: October 1–9, 2024

![Rhodes, Old Town.](images/Rhodes_Old_Town_cat_IMG_3093.jpg)

We began October by traveling to the eastern extreme of the Aegean—the island of Rhodes. 

Rhodes was and still is a crossroads. It sits at the intersection between the Aegean and the Mediterranean and between Greece and Minor Asia. This made it a vital travel stop and military location in ancient and medieval times. It was also a cultural center; Cicero and Julius Caesar both studied rhetoric there.

Today, Rhodes is a key stop on many Mediterranean ferry routes. It is home to a busy army base and airport. It's also on the flightpath of numerous international routes; every day, we watched airliners pass overhead on their journeys from Frankfurt to Nairobi, or Heathrow to Dubai. 

And, of course, it's a tourist mecca. For the first time since we arrived in Greece, we found ourselves in company—sometimes a little and sometimes far more than was comfortable. 

## October 1: Embonas

We began our first day Rhodes at sea, sitting on deck of our Blue Star ferry drinking coffee and watching the coast of Turkey go by.

![The ferry stopped at the island of Symi before docking in the port of Rhodes an hour late.](images/Symi_IMG_2628.jpg)

Our local [Trekking Hellas](https://trekking.gr) reps, Maria and two guys whose names I don't remember, met us at the ferry port. We piled into a Trekking Hellas van for our transfer to the town of [Embonas](https://www.greeka.com/dodecanese/rhodes/villages/embonas/).

Rhodes City is full of Italian architecture from the 1930s, back when Italy briefly occupied the island. Maria acknowledged that the Italian occupation really did wonders for the appearance of the city. The ride down the west coast road is stunningly beautiful, with blue seascapes the whole way. Rhodes is bigger than I realized; it took about 90 minutes to drive to Embonas (accent on the first syllable). 

Along the way, Maria and the guys told us about Rhodes. Here's what we learned:

1. The west side of Rhodes is the "wet" side, and the east is very dry.
1. The east side suffered massive wildfires in 2023, to the point that thousands of tourists had to be evacuated.
1. Rhodes City has its own university.
1. Embonas is famous for its food and wine.
1. There's an important army base on the west side.
1. The number one industry in Rhodes, by far, is tourism.
1. There are numerous small islands just off the west coast of Rhodes, some of which are (just barely) inhabited. Several lack fresh water and have it shipped in from Rhodes.

After about an hour, we turned inland onto the winding, climbing road that leads to reach [Embonas](https://www.greeka.com/dodecanese/rhodes/villages/embonas/), which gave us our first inkling of how hilly Rhodes is. We checked in to the [Hotel Attaviros](https://www.ataviroshotel.com), where we were to spend the next three nights for Trekking Hellas' [Hiking Rhodes (Self-Guided)](https://trekking.gr/en/excursions/hiking-rhodes-self-guided).

Maria and the guys gave us a quick briefing on our four hikes. Instead of hiking from hotel to hotel, in Rhodes we would stay in two different base towns and do day hikes from them. Of the three hikes we'd do from Embonas, Profitis Ilias would be easy, Attaviros would be the hardest and sunniest, Akramitis would be in the middle. Then we would move on to Lindos, where we would walk around the coast. Maria advised us to bring lots of water. 

Having left us with a loan of trekking poles "just in case" and a parting gift of [melekouni](https://www.greekgastronomyguide.gr/en/geuseis/glyka-me-meli/melekouni-rodou/), Maria *et al.* headed back to the big city. We ventured forth in search of some of the wonderful food for which Embonas is known. 

Embonas clearly expects a steady stream of tourists to come through, many of them in buses. There are several restaurants with picture menus—which doesn't in itself mean the food isn't good, but it's not the best sign. We settled on a taverna that started empty but then filled with long tables of tourists.

Lunch was perfectly good but nothing out of the ordinary—Chris has observed that every taverna in Greece has essentially the same menu, and all boast of "Greek Specialities!". We left the restaurant wondering what exactly made Embonas food so famous. 

What is there to do in Embonas if you're not eating? Well, you can go for a stroll in the main street, dodging vehicles. You can shop for souvenirs at two or three shops. You can taste wine at one of several wineries. That'll fill a tidy half hour.

If you're staying at a hotel in Embonas, you can lounge by the pool. 

Otherwise, Embonas is pretty chill.

![The sunset over our pool was glorious.](images/Embonas_sunset_IMG_2657.jpg)

## October 2: Profitis Ilias

Today was the easy day—the small peak Profitis Ilias, the third-highest mountain on Rhodes. This was the first of many Profitis Iliases we encountered in the Aegean. The name, which means "Profit Elijah," seems to have caught the eye of many a mountain-namer. If you see a mountain in the eastern or southern Aegean, there's a fair chance it's called Profitis Ilias.

The trailheads for our Embonas walks were all some distance from Embonas itself, so the plan was for Manolis, the hotel owner Yannis's dad, to drive us. Manolis doesn't speak English at all, so my Greek got a workout. 

![We stopped on the way to let the chickens out of their coop.](images/chickens.mov)

Manolis drove us to the town of Salakos. When he let us out at the trail, he explained  we should meet him at a taverna in town, owned (it seemed) by another guy named Manolis. I assumed we'd figure it out when we got there.

Chris was still feeling rough from a stomach bug he caught in Nafplio, so we went slowly. 

![This church is at the top of the trail.](images/Profitis_Ilias_church_IMG_2694.jpg)

![Amazing view from the church deck!](images/Profitis_Ilias_church_edge_IMG_2697.jpg)

![We sat in a field of wild onions while Chris flew his drone from the hilltop.](images/DJI_20241002040331_0013_D.mov)

At the top of Profitis Ilias sit two hotels, Elafos (male deer) and Elafina (female deer), which were built by Italians in 1929 and 1930; the Elafos was originally called the *Albergo del Cervo*, which means "Hotel of the Deer" in Italian. A number of British cyclists sat at the outdoor cafe tables discussing purity of nutrition and the role of caffeine in training and life in general. 

![An unexpected Alpine touch in Rhodes.](images/Profitis_Ilias_hotel_IMG_2706.jpg)

![There's a monastery up there too, of course.](images/Profitis_Ilias_Monastery_IMG_2707.jpg)

There was nothing much else to do up on Profitis Ilias, so we headed back down to the town of Salakos.

![Trails in Rhodes are consistently rocky.](images/Profitis_Ilias_trail_view_IMG_2710.jpg)

![The view as you walk down off the plateau is terrific.](images/profitis_ilias.mov)

![A holly oak, or maybe a kermes oak?](images/Profitis_Ilias_holy_oak_IMG_2713.jpg)
 
The town  is cute, with a number of old houses being renovated; most homes are beautifully kept and decorated with flowering plants. 

We couldn't remember where exactly Manolis had told us to meet him, and I doubted that my Greek was up to a consultation, so we just sat at one of the tavernas in the plateia and ordered drinks. Our plan was to skip lunch, lest we turn into fat puddings. I regret to this day that we didn't at least order a [horiatiki](https://realgreekrecipes.com/classic-greek-salad-recipe/) to share. After seeing the yiayia prepping her salad tomatoes with exquisite care, I began to get an inkling of why everyone sings the praises of food from this area. It's not fancy; it's just prepared from the freshest ingredients by people who take this work seriously. 

![Word to the wise: order some food!](images/Salakos_taverna_IMG_2714.jpg)

It turned out Manolis had been sitting at the taverna across the street waiting for us. He had visited the chickens again and had a bucket of fresh eggs along with some wild herbs he'd gathered.

![These eggs were delicious for breakfast the next morning.](images/Embonas_eggs_IMG_2716.jpg)

On the ride back to Embonas, I asked Manolis which taverna was the best in Embonas. He recommended [Maroullakis](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g2295770-d6717255-Reviews-Maroullakis_Taverna-Embonas_Rhodes_Dodecanese_South_Aegean.html), which is where we ate that evening

At dinner, my hypothesis was confirmed: the food in western Rhodes is famous because of its perfection of ingredients and preparation, not because it's fancy. Maroullakis features the same dishes that appear on every taverna menu throughout Greece. But the meat and vegetables are local and fresh. My lamb was perfectly grilled and flavorful. (Lamb in Greece tastes nothing like lamb in the U.S.) The wine was cheap and delicious. Tourists must come here seeking a pastoral connection to the land, a trip into a simpler past.

![This cat, Psipsinil, helps manage Maroullakis.](images/Embonas_taverna_cat_Psipsinil_IMG_2760.jpg)

## October 3: Attaviros

Today's mission was to climb to the summit of [Attaviros](https://www.greeka.com/dodecanese/rhodes/sightseeing/attaviros-zeus-temple/), the highest mountain on Rhodes. We were promised simultaneous views of the Mediterranean and Aegean (well, from the same spot; obviously a single human couldn't see them both in the same moment). Chris was feeling recovered, and we were both ready to take on a challenging hike!

The hike today would have no shade and no water sources, so we had to carry all the fluids we'd need. 

Manolis dropped us off at the trailhead just outside the town of Agios Isidoros. He left us with instructions to walk into town and find him at Petros' taverna when we were done. 

The total distance for this out-and-back hike was 16.6 km, or 10.3 miles. The Trekking Hellas materials said it could take 3.5 or 4 hours to climb to the summit, meaning a total time of at least 7 or 8 hours. Before we left the hotel, Yannis had told Manolis to be back in Agios Isidoros to collect us around 2:30, which seemed optimistic. 

We got out of the car around 9:30. So making the summit was going to be a challenge if we were to be back by 2:30, or even 4:30.

To cut to the chase: we didn't make the summit. Nor did we make it to Agios Isidoros at 2:30. 

The challenges began at the beginning. We couldn't find the trail. It started at the bottom of a gully that had evidently had quite a torrent of water flowing through it recently. 

![Where did the trail go?](images/Attaviros_washed_out_trail_IMG_2718.jpg)

The riverbed was a mishmash of random rocks that we clambered over feeling stupid until I spotted the distinctive straight line of a trail up the far bank. We reached it with only a little scrambling and began our walk. 

It was unrelentingly steep, rocky, and spiky. Also sunny. No shade on Attaviros!

![The trail up Attaviros is unusually rocky, even for Rhodos.](images/Attaviros_rocky_trail_IMG_2722.MOV)

![This plant, spiky burnet, is absolutely everywhere.](images/Attaviros_spiky_burnet_IMG_2724.jpg)

We ascended doggedly and finally crested a rise to reach the level of the windmills that cover the tops of the mountains. 

![Look how dry this landscape is!](images/Attaviros_high_scan_IMG_2733.MOV)

We were still climbing at 1 pm, and it was pretty clear that we stood no chance of making our pickup time even if we turned around right then and there. We figured Manolis didn't mind hanging out at a taverna shooting the breeze with his buddies for an hour or two, so we took a break for Chris to fly the drone. Then we headed back down that thorny, rocky trail.

![The drone reveals that we were pretty close to the top when we turned around!](images/DJI_20241003054729_0005_D.mov)

I'd brought along Maria's trekking poles to see if they might help me speed up my descents. I've tried and discarded the things multiple times in the past, but people do swear by them. To be clear, it's not my knees that I'm worried about, and I remain unconvinced that flimsy poles can offer more assistance to knees than simply wearing shoes that allow full ankle flexibility. I just have short legs and a sometimes wonky hip, and find big steps down a bit difficult, especially if I'm trying not to rake my calves through the spiky plants that completely cover the trail in places. (I could wear long pants or gaiters; I choose staying cool over leg protection.) Touching fingertips to a wall or the hand of a partner is helpful for balance shifts—not as a support, but just as data—and I still think poles might be a useful aid to proprioception.

Alas, it was not to be. As per usual, I mainly found that the poles got in the way of my own balance and ability to use my hands to navigate the terrain. (I see nothing wrong with descending very steep sections on my butt....) I remain open to using poles in Nepal—maybe they'll make all the difference on the scary sections.

![It was sunny and dusty!](images/Attaviros_Amy_IMG_2755.jpg)

We clambered down the last rocks into the washed-out riverbed close to 4:00 PM. Another 15 minutes and we were at Petros' tavern, where Manolis had clearly been installed for some time. After a quick lemonade, we headed back to Embonas and the pool.

![Nothing like a dip in cold water to head off sore leg muscles!](images/Embonas_pool_IMG_2649.jpg)

That evening, we returned to Maroullakis for more wonderful local meat. I asked the hostess what I should try this time, since the lamb was so good. She suggested liver. It's not my favorite, but I've been trying to train myself out of my American prejudices against one of the healthiest foods in existence, so liver I had. 

![Psipsinil DOES like liver.](images/Embonas_dinner_IMG_2762.jpg)

## October 4: Akramitis to Lindos

Today we were to climb Akramitis, the second-highest peak in Rhodes. This was our last morning in Embonas, and I was genuinely sorry to leave. Of all the places we stayed, the one of the ones where we felt the most at home.

Manolis drove us to the trailhead near [Monolithos village](https://monolithos-village.gr/en/), where we said goodbye. 

![I was going to miss Manolis!](images/Akramitis_Amy_Manolis_IMG_2764.jpg)

A fire had clearly swept through this forest in the recent past.

![Everything was ashes.](images/Akramitis_fire_IMG_2765.jpg)

We somehow lost the trail early on and found ourselves clinging to boulders while below us, hikers passed on by with ease. Maria had assured us that the trail up Akramitis was easier than Attaviros, so why was this so difficult and scary?

Note to self: if the trail seems unreasonably climby, you are not on the trail. Go back and find it.

We finally came to our senses, clambered back down, went right where previously we'd gone left, and found ourselves on a trail that, while definitely uphill, required no use of our hands. 

![The correct trail.](images/Akramitis_trail_IMG_2769.jpg)

And it was definitely worth continuing, because Akramitis gave us the best views we had in all of Rhodes. 

![View of the Aegean.](images/Akramitis_Aegean_view_IMG_2778.jpg)

We were already late for turnaround, but we stayed on the summit to fly the drone.

![Amazing drone video from Akramitis.](images/DJI_20241004060205_0009_D.mov)

![Droney McDroneFace III does remarkably well in a stiff breeze.](images/Akramitis_drone_IMG_2787.jpg)

One difficulty with pickups and dropoffs is that you have to guess when you'll finish a hike, which can be hard to do when you don't know the terrain and can't even predict when you might start walking. But drivers typically have to travel an hour or more from Rhodes City, so they need ample notice. We'd guessed that we'd probably start walking at 9:30, and we added a good 90 minutes to the estimated 3.5 hour hiking time. We certainly didn't want to have to sit on the side of the road for an hour or more. I thought 1:30 would be ample, letting us make a leisurely ascent with time to play at the summit.  

On the other hand, we definitely don't want to seriously inconvenience the people taking care of us, and we did do that. We got back to the trailhead about 45 minutes after our expected return time. This was entirely due to our 45 minutes of impromptu bouldering at the start of the hike. Our new friend Panos very graciously didn't hold this against us.

Panos drove us through the interior of the island to bring us to the east coast, where we saw just how much drier the Mediterranean side is. Last year's wildfires have left the landscape black and desolate. 

Turning north on the eastern coastal road, we came to our new destination, the beautiful but extremely touristic town of [Lindos](https://www.greecetravel.com/rhodes/lindos/index.htm).

![Panos went to a lot of trouble to drive to a place where he could make a big reveal.](images/Lidos_view_across_bay_IMG_2915.jpg)

![Lindos has no cars. Everyone parks up here and drags their suitcases down the hill.](images/Lindos_parking_lot_IMG_2831.jpg)

We installed ourselves in [Esel Suites](https://www.lindoseselsuites.gr), a small guesthouse centered around a courtyard hidden behind the whitewashed walls. The "esel" of the name refers to the donkey Benjamin that stars in a German children's book, [*Mein Esel Benjamin*](https://www.lindoseselsuites.gr/benjamin/), which tells the tale of a family that moved to Rhodes for peace and fell in love with a little donkey. 

![On the steps of the Esel Suites.](images/IMG_2834.jpg)

After some weeks on the road, it was time for some wardrobe restocking, so we headed off in search of socks and underwear. First we stopped for ice cream at [Gelo Blue](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g227884-d3507815-Reviews-Gelo_Blu-Lindos_Rhodes_Dodecanese_South_Aegean.html), which Panos had recommended as the best ice cream in town. No dispute here.

So, clothes shopping: Lindos is a town of narrow, winding streets utterly crammed with little shops selling souvenirs and expensive designer clothes. What you apparently cannot buy is basics. Swimsuits of all types? No problem. T-shirts featuring the Pythagorean Theorem? Sure. Plain white t-shirts? Nah. There were socks aplenty, featuring evil eyes or kitty cats or the Colossus of Rhodes, but no underwear of any kind.

Do people in Lindos not wear underwear?

![Lindos does have shops selling the beautiful linen shirts that say "summertime in the Mediterranean."](images/Lindos_Chris_acropolis_IMG_2982.jpg)

Our local contacts recommended the restaurant [Dionysos](https://dionysoslindos.gr), so we grabbed a table on the rooftop terrace. At night, Lindos is all rooftop terraces - every building has a restaurant or bar open to the sky and visible all around. It's a beautiful setting, and the food was good, don't get me wrong.

But after weeks of Greek country food and unpretentious local wines in carafes or plastic bottles and not worrying how we were dressed, it was jarring to be amongst smarmy waiters and stylish crowds, forced to order elegant cuisine and wine in a glass bottle with a label. We have fine dining at home! We missed Embonas.

![Fancy food at Dionysos.](images/Lindos_Dionysos_fancy_food_IMG_2838.jpg)

We agreed that Lindos was the sort of place we'd have loved as middle schoolers—atmospheric, narrow alleyways and secret courtyards behind whitewashed walls, waiters and salespeople who pretend friendship, charming souvenir shops, donkey rides. But I cannot imagine trying to navigate those streets in August! A single stroller can clog the lanes in October, so they must be impassible in high summer. If you visit Lindos in August, try not to need EMS.

## October 5: Lindos

Today's walk was meant to start in the neighboring town of Vlicha, go up and around the back of the hills above Lindos, and then complete a loop by walking from Lindos back to Vlicha on the seaside path. I suppose the idea is to give the tourists another full day's hike, but who wants to arrive home after a long and dusty hike and then keep going to another town, requiring a taxi ride back to the starting point?

Also, at this point, we pretty much had the idea about Rhodian hill paths—and the ones on the east side are so very black and dusty—so we decided just to walk from Vlicha straight to Lindos on the coastal path.

We started by inconveniencing two taxi drivers.

Breakfast at Esel Suites is served to the handful of guests in the tiny courtyard at 9:00. Time not negotiable.

![Breakfast served here.](images/Lindos_Esel_Suites_table_IMG_2933.jpg)

But Trekking Hellas had arranged for a driver to pick us up at 8:00 to transport us to the day's trailhead. The night before, Chris had called the taxi service and asked to move our pickup to 10:00. The telophone conversation was not promising, and predictably had no effect, because that morning at 8:30 we got a message from Trekking Hellas asking why we hadn't met our driver. Sigh.

The driver who did collect us in the upper parking lot at 10:00 thought we wanted to go to the airport in Heraklion, a solid hour away. ("Where are your suitcases???") He was dismayed to discover that he'd canceled another fare for what turned out to be a five-minute transfer down the beach. We hooked him up with a nice gratuity to offset the opportunity cost.

In any case, we finally found ourselves on the beach in Vlicha, with only a short hike up and over a hill to bring us back to Lindos.

![The beach at Vlicha is covered with these lilies.](images/Lindos_lily_IMG_2844.jpg)

![Vlicha beach, looking desolate in the morning.](images/Lindos_Vlicha_IMG_2848.jpg)

Was it easy? Ha! Of course not!

Remember, everywhere in Rhodes is hilly and rocky. And dry, dusty, and hot. We had to climb up and we had to climb back down, negotiating rocks and spiky plants as always.

![A rocky landscape.](images/Lindos_rock_trail_above_town_IMG_2827.jpg)

![A cave!](images/Lindos_inside_cave_IMG_2899.jpg)

![A fossil!](images/Lindos_fossil_IMG_2894.jpg)

But we could take out time and fly the drone, and though I didn't love the touristic ambiance of Lindos, I had to admit it was breathtakingly beautiful. I took more photos here than anywhere else in Rhodes.

![Lots of yachts pull in to the many bays around Lindos, for a day of swimming and picnicking.](images/DJI_20241005054117_0004_D.mov)

We got back to the beach on the north side of Lindos around 1:00. 

![The amazingly beautiful beach at Lindos.](images/Lindos_city_and_beach_IMG_2916.jpg)

Chris sat at a taverna while I went swimming. The Lindos beach is a lovely, soft sand much more to my taste than the pebbles that are prevalent in most areas. The water gets deeper very gradually and there were no waves whatsoever. This would be a great beach for little kids.

Greek beaches tend to be "full service", covered with umbrellas and *chaises longues*, with waiters who deliver food and drink from the beachfront tavernas.

We grabbed another gelato at Gelo Blu. I highly recommend the combo of strachiatella, pistachio, and fior di latte. [Fior di latte](https://www.bonappetit.com/story/fior-di-latte-gelato?srsltid=AfmBOorWa3cF2UFa6J20uTsp7DNuSH9GF2zYs-7M6d4UtjdT3OCjB3HO) is apparently the test of a gelateria's quality. Made of just cream and sugar, it showcases the purity of the simplest of ingredients and the care taken in freezing the concoction.

We returned to the beach that evening to dine at a seafood taverna, which was much more in the style that we'd come to favor. 

![The sort of view I want from a seafood restaurant.](images/Lindos_beach_sunset_IMG_2947.jpg)

![The famous Symi shrimp are eaten whole, shells and all. Crunchy!](images/Lindos_Symi_shrimp_IMG_2959.jpg)

![Twilight in Lindos.](images/Lindos_twilight_IMG_2963.jpg)

## October 6: Lindos—Kritika

![Dawn in Lindos.](images/Lindos_dawn_IMG_2840.jpg)

We'd planned to spend the morning visiting the Lindos Acropolis, the area's main archaeological site. Chris was even open to the idea of riding a donkey!

Alas, as is increasingly the case when we travel now, the line to get in to the site was discouraging enough to dissuade us. And the donkeys seemed very, very small. Instead, we watched other people ride up the cobbles to the acropolis.

![Tourists waiting to get into the Acropolis.](images/Lindos_tourists_acropolis_IMG_2974.jpg)

![The donkey rides are apparently controversial, but it does look fun.](images/Lindos_donkey_kids_IMG_3003.jpg)

We walked around the hillside to get some good views of the Mediterranean. The hill below the Acropolis is a great place to gave off in the direction of Cyprus—the world beyond the Aegean.

![The Mediterranean, not the Aegean!](images/Lindos_Mediterranean_from_acropolis_IMG_2979.mov)

![Chris making professor videos.https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/miso/Hosting-1100821539519665592/original/f55d189e-8806-4e57-9c36-d99258e457ea.jpeg?sw_cache=trips_images&im_w=960&im_format=avif](images/Lindos_Chris_filming_IMG_2995.jpg)

![The beach at Lindos is beautiful from all directions.](images/Lindos_beach_from_town_IMG_3007.jpg)

Then it was time to leave Lindos. We dragged our suitcases back up to the parking lot to await Panos. Rhodes is not a place to travel if you're not prepared to do at least a modicum of physical labor!

![You can look down on St. Paul's Bay from the parking lot.](images/Lindos_St_Pauls_bay_IMG_3026.jpg)

Panos drove us up the east coast of Rhodes past the apparently famous [Anthony Quinn bay](https://manosgoing.com/anthony-quinns-bay/). Who is [Anthony Quinn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Quinn), you might ask. It turns out that he was a Mexican-American actor who got cast in Greek and other ethnic roles in movies in the 1960s. He played a Cretan soldier in *The Guns of Navarone*, which was filmed in Rhodes in 1961. This performance led to his star turn as the titular character in *Zorba the Greek*. While Quinn was in Rhodes filming *Navarone*, he bought the bay now named after him; his plans to create a film-making center there didn't pan out, but Rhodians still use his name for the bay and are probably the main people responsible for keeping the memory *The Guns of Navarone* alive. 

Along the way, Panos explained that [Kritika](https://www.kalimera-greece.eu/rhodes-resorts/kritika-resort-rhodes/) was settled by Muslims who fled Crete in the early 1920s. Panos dropped us off at our [AirBnB](https://www.airbnb.co.uk/rooms/1100821539519665592?source_impression_id=p3_1736085288_P3O0-bSONzFB0aJj), where we were greeted by Stephanos, father of the Kostas who runs the online listings.

![Our place in Kritika was a beautiful little house!](images/Kritika_house_yard_IMG_3063.jpg)

![It was separated from the street-front house by a large garden.](images/Kritika_yard_IMG_3029.jpg)

![This gate was locked at all times.](images/Kritika_gate_to_house_IMG_3068.jpg)

I'd chosen this house based on its alleged proximity to a supermarket—just 500 meters away—and on the mistaken belief that it was actually in Rhodes City. I was wrong on both counts.

We started a load of laundry and then walked south in search of the promised supermarket. 

Kritika itself is basically just a single row of houses facing the beachfront road, some of them (like ours) with new houses built in the back yards. Though websites call it a "traditional village," there's not much there.

![This is Kritika.](images/Kritika_street_evening_MG_3066.jpg)

![Some houses could use some work.](images/Kritika_collapsed_house_IMG_3074.jpg)

![The west coastal road.](images/Kritika_our_street_IMG_3071.jpg)

After a much-longer-than-expected walk, we arrived at a little shopping area featuring a Thai restaurant, a Korean restaurant, and a "Supermarket", really a convenience store specializing in sunscreen, cigarettes, beach toys, and booze. A grocery store this was not. 

NB: the word "supermarket" in Greece doesn't necessarily mean large grocery store in the American sense. Though "minimarkets" are pretty consistently small to tiny, supermarkets can also be very small. 

We gave up on shopping for supplies and decided to walk the other direction, north toward Rhodes City. 

![The walk to town is partly along this beach.](images/Kritika_sunset_IMG_3032.jpg)

Arriving in town, we discovered that half the businesses in Rhodes are car rental establishments. On the spur of the moment, we decided that we needed our own wheels. It would be easy to park in front of our house, and a car would make it possible to visit places that were otherwise inaccessible, like, any store that could sell us food (and this was BEFORE we discovered how dicey the bus and taxi situation was).

We asked for something cheap. They told us we could pick it up the next morning.

Transport secured, we walked into town to see what Rhodes City was all about. What it appears to be all about is traffic, along with lots of shops and restaurants for tourists. 

We dined at a restaurant on the beach at the northern tip of the island, where we could watch planes flying overhead and ferries coming in and out of port. (Shout out to the fun [FlightAware](https://www.flightaware.com) app!)

## October 7: Rhodes City

The previous night, we'd taken a taxi back to Kritika to avoid having to figure out the buses. This morning, we thought we'd take the bus into town to collect our rental car.

We sat at the bus stop and waited. And waited. Finally, a northbound bus approached—and drove right past us without stopping. It was crammed full of people probably collected at the hotels south of us. Maybe buses weren't going to be an option after all.

After a few more minutes of this, we walked back up the beach road into town. It's not a terrible walk, but 25 minutes to reach the outskirts is too long of a walk to be reasonable transportation.

Our car was a red Toyota Avgo. "Avgo" means "egg" in Greek. The rental guy assured Chris that the transmission wasn't broken, bogginess notwithstanding, and we drove off into the Rhodes City traffic. We didn't learn until later that it "sported" a 3-cylinder engine, at which point Chris, who had been driving it, said, "That explains a lot."

The thing about driving in Rhodes—well, there are two thing. First, there's the matter that the city was built long before there were cars, so modern traffic is completely shoehorned into a tiny space. That's normal in Greece. Second, at least half the cars on the road are probably rentals, which means fewer than half the drivers know where they're going. 

Our mission for the morning was to visit the iStorm (*sic*, a fake Apple Store) for a hard disk, and H&M for boring wardrobe staples.

Then we visited a proper grocery store for proper food. On a trip like this a visit to a real grocery store, when you have a real kitchen at your disposal, is better than any Theme Park.

After dinner, we watched *The Guns of Navarone* to see if we could spot locations. We did recognize Lindos and some spots on the east coast. But I find those old movies too long and much too stilted; David Niven was particularly irritating. I may never manage to get through *Zorba the Greek*. Also the Amazon Prime print of *Guns…* was really, really dark; there was a presumably exciting scene involving a shipwreck and our heroes scaling a sheer cliff, but we could see nothing of the action whatsoever.

## October 8: Island Driving Tour

We started the morning with coffee and yogurt on the patio while I did a last load of laundry. You have to plan these things—clothes do dry quickly in Rhodes, but you still need to budget several hours, and those hours really ought to be under sunlight.

Neither of us really wanted to visit tourist attractions or explore the old town, so we decided to do a driving tour of the island. We headed through the suburbs to the east coast road and aimed south toward Lindos. This is tourism central, and the traffic was irritating until we'd passed Lindos. 

But then the road was wide open! South Rhodes is largely undeveloped. There are a few beach establishments and some holiday homes, but generally there's nothing—no tavernas, no stores. 

![We stopped at this lovely new beach view taverna just before the road turned to the west.](images/Rhodes_southeast_coast_IMG_3051.jpg)

Chris had been intrigued by the tavernas in Monolithos when we passed through there on our way from Akramitis to Lindos, so we headed there for lunch.

Then it was back north, driving back through the roads we'd traveled in our first days in Rhodes. We were back in Kritika by 2:30. 

That evening, we drove back to town to return our rental. We checked out the Old Town, which turned out to be underwhelming. It's basically Old-Town-Disneyworld, all shops and restaurants set up to cater to huge crowds of tourists. Many of these tourists arrive on cruise ships and spend the day in Rhodes but eat and sleep on board; it makes for dense daytime populations.

## October 9: Rhodes City to Blue Star Ferry

This was our last day in Rhodes, and it was the beginning of one of our few awkwardly scheduled days. For the most part, this trip didn't involve any dead time waiting for transport, but some waiting around with our suitcases was unavoidable between Rhodes and Crete. We had to leave the house by 11:00 AM, but the ferry didn't leave until 6:00 PM. That meant killing several hours with luggage, which is never fun.

Today was also the day to refine our packing. We'd been slightly overpacked, which didn't matter when we had a car, but now we needed to be lean and mean. I tossed out my beloved [Lems Primals](https://www.lemsshoes.com/products/womens-primal-pursuit?variant=39389104472122&country=US) (it would be all [Altra Lone Peaks](https://www.altrarunning.com/en-us/trail/womens-lone-peak-9/AL0A85PR.html) in Crete) along with several garments and some underused cosmetics. Chris left his old Lone Peaks and several under-used electronic objects. We were finally at fighting weight!

Our host Stephen met us at the house to see us on our way. He'd assumed we could just take the bus into town. I suspect he doesn't use the bus himself (he rides a scooter) and didn't know what we'd discovered—the buses don't stop in Kritika, at least not in the late morning. Nor would a northbound cab stop—they were all loaded up with tourists leaving their hotels and heading to the airport. 

![Waiting for a ride….](images/Kritika_Chris_bags_IMG_3070.jpg)

We finally flagged down a cab heading the wrong direction, and persuaded him to take us to the port. On the way, he told us how insane traffic is in the summer, when the tourist burden is at its highest. 

We spent the afternoon sitting at a taverna, eating lunch and working on our computers. 

At 3:00, we dragged out suitcases down to the port, intending to board the ferry and ditch our stuff in our cabin. But the ferry wasn't there. After some investigating, I figured out why. These ferries run what are essentially bus routes, stopping in at various islands for a few minutes and then moving onward. Our ferry originated in Karpathos, and was going to stop in Rhodes for just a quick pickup.

This meant killing another couple of hours. Happily there was a [Grygorys](https://www.gregorys.gr) (basically, Greek [QuickTrip](https://duckduckgo.com)).

And we were off, back across the Aegean!
