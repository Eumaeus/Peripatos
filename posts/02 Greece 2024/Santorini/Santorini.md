# Santorini: October 10–12, 2024

![Santorini, the wildly-popular, and romantic (see right), island.](images/Megalochori_view_from_rock_ferry_IMG_3377.MOV)

We hadn't really intended to visit Santorini. It is a super-popular destination for tourists, and that wasn’t what we were after on this trip. 

But the ferry routes conspired to send us there. Though in summer it's easy to get a ferry straight from Rhodes to Crete, by mid-October the options are more limited. The day that we left Rhodes, no ferries sailed directly to Crete. (If I'd checked the schedules for the next day, I would have found one, and we would have taken it, but then we'd never have gone to Santorini!)

Sailing from Rhodes on October 9, we had to go to Piraeus. And sailing from Piraeus to Crete on October 10, we had to stop in Santorini. And if we were stopping in Santorini, we figured we might as well get off and see what all the fuss was about. It would be late enough in the season that we'd be able to move around; we wouldn't lose our minds from crowds.

And it would be good to see the place. [Santorini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santorini) used to be the volcanic island Thira (Θήρα), which famously erupted around 3,600 years ago. This event is sometimes suggested as the origin of the myth of [Atlantis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantis), the island nation that sank into the sea. Santorini's distinctive crescent shape is entirely the result of it having once exploded spectacularly (and many times before and after, albeit less spectacularly). The geography alone had to be interesting.

So to Santorini we went!

## October 10: Pireaus–SeaJets–Megalochori

We spent October 10 kicking around Piraeus, killing time until our [SeaJets ferry](https://www.seajets.com/?gad_source=1&gbraid=0AAAAADjz3DsoGk7owERWOYN0ZptUJ9f3d&gclid=Cj0KCQiA4fi7BhC5ARIsAEV1YiZCNOm6C2eMMzu6M6vaclCNhRrFDB-pQau0YIFe_DKZuM_qOdmSfbMaAqo5EALw_wcB) departure at 4 pm. The ferry was late, and there are no waiting areas at the Piraeus docks. We sat on the concrete ledge next to a ticket building, grabbing the shade before the full crowd arrived. I amused myself by spying on a couple of families who looked like they were out of [*White Lotus*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13406094/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_1_tt_7_nm_0_in_0_q_white%2520lotus), all Gucci sunglasses and Rolex and spreading out Hermes scarves on the concrete so they wouldn't have to sit directly on it.

They were going to Mykonos.

The ferry, when it came, was small and fast. The seats are set up kind of like in an airplane, but with wider rows. The area up front where we were assigned seats was crowded, and there was no real space in the seating area for backpacks. I quickly moved to the back, where fewer people were sitting. There's a first-class area upstairs; if we were to sail in the high season, we'd definitely consider paying for that. I can't imagine this ferry with a full load of passengers. (Or rather, I can imagine it all too well.)

Because it is a “fast ferry”, you can’t go on deck when it is cruising along, only when it slows to dock somewhere. Smokers have a hard time on the fast ferries.

The ride to Santorini took nearly six hours. This is partly because the ferry stops at numerous islands along the way: Syros, Tinos, Myknonos, Paros, Naxos, and finally Santorini. Since we were stuck island hopping through the [Cyclades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclades), I went on deck at every stop to see what I could see. 

![Our first stop was Syros, capital of the Cyclades and reportedly the original home of the swineherd Eumaeus.](images/Syros_port_IMG_3153.MOV)

![Many of our fellow travelers got off in Mykonos, which doesn't look like a party madhouse from the deck.](images/Mykonos_port_IMG_3154.MOV)

Every time the ferry started back up, we got to watch the safety video twice—first Greek, then English. Twelve times total! 

Apparently not that many people sail all the way to Santorini on this ferry, because the time we docked in Santorini after 11:00, it was nearly empty. The seas were rough, and the ferry crew helped every passenger off the boat onto the heaving ramp. Our driver was waiting for us.

Before we left the U.S., somewhat overwhelmed by AirBnB’s number of available listings in Santorini, I had chosen a ["Cycladic rooftop cottage with jacuzzi"](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/49894908?source_impression_id=p3_1736348341_P3Kw4y02Lm_F-793) in the town of [Megalochori](https://www.santorini.com/villages/megalochorivillage.htm). 

I was somewhat bemused when our host offered to send a driver to pick us up for €25, which seemed awfully high for a place that appeared to be right next to the port. But, I thought, we were arriving so late, it would be nice to have someone who knew the area take us straight to the house. 

I imagined that in the daytime, we'd have no trouble walking down to the water.

Hahahaha! Foolish woman!

Remember, Greece is steep. Santorini is basically a circular cliff hundreds of feet high, with most housing up on the top. Megalochori is indeed right next to the ferry port--and about 1000 feet straight above it.

> **Tip:** You really need to do trip-planning in Greece with a topographical map! Chris swears by [GaiaGPS](https://www.gaiagps.com), both online and as an iPhone app while hiking. The iPhone app works great when there is no signal, up in the mountains!

![The 1000\' cliff between the port and our AirBnB](images/cliff_map.jpg)

The road to Megalochori took 15 minutes to DRIVE, and was entirely a serpentine up a cliff face. 

![Note the buses zigzagging up the cliff, and the hotels on the top. A few hundred linear meters, **and a few hundred vertical meters** away!](images/Santorini_ferry_port_IMG_3392.MOV)

The town itself is nearly unnavigable by motor vehicles. The main road is lined by plaster-walled buildings leaving exactly the width of a sedan. Fortunately there was no traffic at midnight, because our driver just parked the car at the alley leading up to our apartment, completely blocking the road. He carried our suitcases up the steep steps, opened the door, and we were in!

Our apartment was at the top of a collection of houses, many of which are operated by the [same company that rented our AirBnB](https://casasantorini.gr). 

Megalochori is densely built, with most buildings sharing walls. Rooftops lead to stairs that lead to sidewalks and plazas; it seems that it's fine to walk across roofs to reach the stairs. 

![Rooftop terrain](images/Megalochori_rooftops_IMG_3320.jpg) 

We could look right into the terraces below us, most of which sported hot tubs just like the one on our deck. 

![Not a good place to bathe nude….](images/Megalochori_looking_down_into_next_unit_IMG_3340.jpg)

Far below, a little cat saw us and began making her way up to our place, running along plaster walls and leaping up levels until she arrived on our terrace. She was in quest of food. All we had to offer were some scraps of cheese left over from the previous night's ferry, but she didn't object to a bit of cheddar.

## October 11: Hotel, Fira, Caldera trail, Oia, Megalochori

The morning was misty, which I suppose isn't surprising in a place surrounded by water but which nevertheless surprised me, so dry is Greece. Our outdoor furniture was wet, and my camera lens instantly misted over.

The little cat was still there, but she left when she discovered that we still had only cheese. We never saw her again.

![Chris and our cat have morning coffee.](images/Megalochori_Chris_cat_coffee_IMG_3158.jpg)

Since hiking is our thing, our plan for the day was to hike the caldera trail. [Santorini Dave](https://santorinidave.com/fira-oia-hike#:~:text=The%20hike%20takes%20you%20along,add%20at%20least%20an%20hour.) gives a very thorough description of it. We thought this would be the best way to get a sense of the island in a limited time.

### Getting to Fira

The first trick was to get to the trail's starting point next to the Hotel Atlantis in Fira. Fira is the capital city and the center of the tourism industry, though tourism permeates every inch of Santorini. 

We had no obvious way of getting there, though. There are reports of buses, but we had no idea where to catch one, how to pay for it, or what the schedule might be. Megalochori was on the wrong side of Fira, too, so we would probably have to change busses.

Our AirBnB was owned and operated by [Grand View Hotel](https://www.grandview.gr). Our best option seemed to be to just walk up to the hotel to see if we could arrange a driver. We hauled ourselves up the steep road we'd driven down the previous night, walked north on the main road, and eventually arrived at the hotel. 

![Entrance to Grand View Hotel](images/Santorini_Grand_View_Hotel_entrance_IMG_3348.jpg)

![The view is indeed grand!](images/Megalochori_grand_view_hotel_IMG_3167.jpg)

The manager first sighed, heavily: Why hadn't we called ahead to arrange this? The drivers were so busy! Were we not aware that hotel guests needed to be shuttled to the port? And to Akrotiri? And Pyrgos? But then he acknowledged that there was, as it, a driver available to take us, right away, to Fira. For €25. 

The price seemed fair. It's not that easy to get around Santorini, especially if you don't want to wait for buses that might only come every hour.

Fira seems nice enough, though I wouldn't want to drive there; as always, the roads are so narrow, cars have to take turns using them, which would be maddening in August. Most websites recommend that visitors to Santorini rent a car, and I can see their point, but I also think driving in high summer has nightmare written all over it. No thank you. 

## The Caldera Trail

> Fira to Oia: 6.27 miles; 987 feet ascent (10.1 km; 301 m)

![Map of the trail.](images/hike.png)

![Elevation profile.](images/elevation.png)

Our driver dropped us off at near Hotel Atlantis, where the trail starts.

![There are a few trail markers like this, but it's pretty obvious how the trail goes. Why does the sign to the capital city seem improvised?](images/Santorini_caldera_trail_sign_IMG_3183.jpg)

This trail runs from the capital city, Fira, to Oia at the northwestern tip. It runs along the top of the [caldera](https://volcano.si.edu/volcano.cfm?vn=212040), the depression that formed when the volcano erupted and then collapsed all those years ago. The island in the middle of the caldera is actively growing as volcanic pressures push upwards. It will grow and grow until the next time Santorini explodes. 

The caldera trail might be the very best way to really see the structure of Santorini.

![Santorini in all its glory!](images/Santorini_caldera_view_IMG_3185.MOV)

The trail starts in the town of Fira. We walked on the cobblestoned path past endless souvenir shops and sea-view tavernas and bars. 

![Cactus juice](images/Santorini_cactus_juice_IMG_3174.jpg)

![The cablecar most cruise ship tourists take up and down for their day visits.](images/Santorini_cablecar_IMG_3176.jpg)

This path took us to the next town, Imerovigli, without really leaving development. 

![Lots of the first part of the trail is a narrow walkway between whitewashed buildings.](images/Fira_trail_between_buildings_IMG_3189.jpg)

![Not like the wild trails we're used to.](images/Santorini_trail_in_town_IMG_3193.MOV)

As we approached [Skaros Rock](https://www.greeka.com/cyclades/santorini/sightseeing/skaros-rock/), we passed a [Flying Dress](https://www.flyingdress.photo) photoshoot on a white rooftop. Perhaps you're unfamiliar with this genre of photography, which involves posing a woman against some scenic background. She's attired in a monochrome dress (red, blue, yellow, orange, occasionally white) with a huge skirt that appears to be billowing behind her like a sail in a strong breeze. The secret is the assistants, who stand out of view lofting the skirt so it appears to be flying. Sort of. The illusion is somewhat lessened by the fact that the "wind" doesn't touch the subject's hair, which remains perfectly stationary and coiffed.

![The famous Skaros Rock, and some swimming pools.](images/Santorini_Skaros_IMG_3196.jpg)

The Santorini tourism architectural aesthetic was clear and consistant: Cycladic buildings, whitewash, and blue roofs, structures that look like caves, and water features absolutely everywhere. All hotels have a swimming pool, and most individual units have their own private hot tubs.

!["Caves" with jacuzzis](images/Santorini_caves_with_jacuzzis_IMG_3220.MOV)

I'd expected to see lots of places to stop for refreshments; in the rest of Greece, you can't go ten feet without running into a taverna or minimarket. Not so in Santorini! Or at least not on our trail. We didn't want to stop in the bigger towns because the prices seemed outrageous to our eyes, accustomed to normal Greece as we were. But once we left the towns, there was nothing. Well, not nothing, but just hotels that didn't look like they were open to ordinary passersby, or with restaurants with prices that might be in line in Dubai or Tokyo ([€12 for a *horiatiki*](https://www.aktaionsantorini.com/sites/default/files/aktaion_2024_menu_final_0.pdf)?).

Chris got grumpy. \[Yes, I did. — Chris.\]

The first available food we saw was after a good 90 minutes of walking--a fruit vendor selling his wares out of his car just below the church of Profitis Ilias. We spent €20 on a few peaches (some iffy), some cut-up watermelon, and a bunch of grapes and ate them on the church patio.

![Overpriced snack time!](images/Santorini_fruit_snack_IMG_3239.jpg)

![There are bathrooms here, on the north side of the church.](images/Santorini_bathrooms_here_IMG_3247.jpg)

This was where the trail became an actual trail, as opposed to a cobbled or paved sidewalk.It was as dusty as any Greek trail, and had the added fun of the dust being black--remember, Santorini is an old volcano! Some bits of trail are completely washed out, and others are very rough and loose. Don't try this in fancy shoes!

We spotted a little side-of-the-road snack bar just before the last big hill. *Mirabile dictu*, it was open. 

![Life-giving walnut cake and frappés!](images/Santorini_walnut_cake_frappe_IMG_3250.jpg)

The last section to Oia is the most wild-looking, though it was still far from deserted. Chris flew the drone some here, but even here it was hard to keep people out of the shots.

![Dusty!](images/Santorini_dusty_trail_IMG_3256.jpg)

![Spiky plants are ever present, but not much of a threat on this wide, well-trodden trail.](images/Santorini_spiky_plant_IMG_3282.jpg)

![Some people ride mules over the last big hill leading toward Oia.](images/Santorini_mules_IMG_3266.MOV)

![Walking along the trail, passing mule-trains. This did indeed give the walk an ancient-vibe.](images/drone_mules.mp4)

Oia finally came into view. 

![The path descends to Oia.](images/Santorini_descent_to_Oia_IMG_3279.jpg)

![Oia, looking Cycladic.](images/Santorini_Oia_IMG_3303.jpg)

The hike took us about four hours to complete. It is NOT an easy walk. There is some serious climbing, some rough terrain, and lots of sun exposure. We finished hot, sweaty, and very dirty, too; that volcanic dust is everywhere. It was hot enough in October, and would be blistering in full summer. There are not nearly as many places to get drinks or bathrooms as I expected to find in such a touristic area. While we saw plenty of people walking in light sandals and sundresses, it's worth taking this seriously and wearing actual walking footwear. 


That being said, the scenery was spectacular and it really did give us a great idea of how the island is set up. If you have the time and energy, it's well worth doing some or all of the hike from Fira to Oia or vice versa.

![An excellent promontory on the way in to Oia.](images/drone_circle.mp4)

### Oia

Oia itself didn't especially appeal. We don't need expensive clothes or works of art, and it was too early for a [famous sunset](https://www.santorini-view.com/attractions/sunset-in-oia/). I'm sure the Cycladic architecture is charming, and the restaurants down at Ammoudi Bay sound lovely, but we'd walked far enough and we still had no idea how we'd get back to Megalochori. It now seemed that a bus might even be impossible; we could probably get one to Fira, but we'd be too late to continue on to Megalochori on a different bus.

There was also the matter of dinner. We had such a lovely balcony in Megalochori, it would be a shame not to dine there, but what would we eat? We hadn't found a grocery store in our own town.

We ate a quick lunch at a modest-looking seafood taverna.  

![The shrimp and dolmades were delicious, even though I find it hard to believe that local fishing can provide anywhere near the seafood consumed on the island.](images/Santorini_lunch_IMG_3312.jpg)

Fortified, we solved the dinner problem by buying supplies in a little supermarket---local sausages are almost always available, and along with a couple of tomatoes and cucumbers, some fruit, and a bar of chocolate, all make for a fine balcony-dinner. These stores always have a decent drink supply too, including local wine in plastic bottles.

We solved the transportation problem with money. A local taxi company wasn't very busy in early afternoon, so it would be no problem to send a driver to the other end of the island. For fifty euros. Sure, whatever.

Our driver drove us south along the eastern road, which goes through the low-lying part of the island on the far side of the crater. He was from Thessaloniki. He works in Santorini from mid-March through mid-November, and then returns home to work in his family's business during the winter. 

### Evening at home

Our driver ventured briefly down the main road into Megalochori, but quickly decided his minivan wouldn't make it through. We concurred.

Back in Casa Alta, we made use of our hot tub and chilled. Dinner on the balcony was a genius move!

## October 12: Megalochori–ferry port

We spent this day somewhat at loose ends. We had to be out of the apartment by noon, but our ferry didn't leave until 4 pm. The hotel said we could hang out at the pool until it was time to leave for the port. 

That left the morning. But what to do? The bronze age site [Akrotiri](https://santorinidave.com/santorini-ancient-akrotiri) was fairly close, but it was too far to walk and we didn't have a good way of getting to it. Likewise [Ancient Thira](https://santorinidave.com/santorini-ancient-thera). We didn't have a good way of getting anywhere. 

Chris wanted to work on his computer while we still had the apartment. 

![Dressed for work!](images/Megalochori_Chris_IMG_3338.jpg)

### Megalochori morning

I spent our last couple of hours wandering around Megalochori to make sure I hadn't missed any of its attractions. 

Here's what you can do in Megalochori: You can visit [the Gavalas winery](https://www.gavalaswines.gr). You can shop for souvenirs. You can stroll, or you can terrorize strollers by driving through on a [four-wheeler tour](https://atvsantoriniexperience.com). There's a little more:

![You can buy wood sculptures; I kind of wish I could've bought this cat!](images/Megalochori_wood_carving_shop_IMG_3347.jpg)

![You can venture down old alleys that don't go anywhere in particular.](images/Megalochori_old_corridor_IMG_3331.jpg)

![You can explore a (very small) cave. This is what Santorini's housing used to be like.](images/Megalochori_cave_IMG_3345.jpg)

![You can admire the bell tower.](images/Megalochori_bell_tower_IMG_3343.jpg)

If you're actually staying in Megalochori, you can sit in your hot tub. I got the feeling that the tourists wandering Megalochori didn't know what to do themselves. There are only so many souvenirs one can buy or meals one can eat.

### Grand View Hotel

The hotel sent a driver to pick us up at noon. We installed ourselves at a table by the pool.

![A nice pool!](images/Megalochori_Hotel_Grand_View_pool_IMG_3349.jpg)

Chris got back to work on the ongoing backing-up of images and video, which was proving immensely time-consuming. I walked around the hotel to a sun-baked promontory that provided some of the best views of the island yet. 

![Absolutely stunning](images/Megalochori_view_IMG_3357.MOV)

Lots of couples come out to this outcropping to take romantic photos. I went and got Chris because the area was screaming for drone shots.

![Droney McDroneface surveys Santorini!](images/drone_hotel.mp4)

Back at the hotel, we were joined at the pool by the members of a wedding party who'd flown in from Washington state for a wedding that evening. They were nice enough, but they were also getting their drink on pretty seriously. When they moved on to the third pitcher of strawberry daiquiris at 3 p.m., Chris and I decided to head down to the port, where we hoped to find something resembling a Greek taverna.

### Ferry port and voyage to Rethymno

And that's where we ended our whirlwind visit to Santorini. The driver told us that this port is an absolute madhouse in the summer, which would be a serious disincentive to rent a car with the intention of returning it here. 

![Ferry port parking, shockingly uncrowded](images/Santorini_ferry_port_parking_IMG_3387.jpg)

There was indeed a Greek taverna that offered up the homey fare we'd become accustomed to, complete with the usual menu of items that weren't actually available. Chris bought shaving cream from the “impulse-buy” rack by the register. 

Our ferry was late. When it finally arrived, we were herded on as fast as possible, with the intention of checking us in after we'd already set sail.

![Boarding the ferry to Rethymno](images/Santorini_ferry_port_boarding_IMG_3399.jpg)

This SeaJets ferry was much bigger than the one we'd ridden to Santorini two days earlier. There were multiple rows of seats across it. It was delightfully uncrowded.

![The crew doubled as a traditional Greek ensemble.](images/ship_band.mp4)

We arrived in Rethymno an hour late. Our driver Kyriakis was waiting there to drive us on to Chania and the start of our Cretan adventure!

## So Santorini?

So, Santorini. Yeah. Some final thoughts.

### Santorini is beautiful.

Truly beautiful. Out-of-this-world, spectacularly, jaw-droppingly beautiful. Almost every place you go has a view of blue water and sky, blindingly white domes, and green islands. Like Macchu Picchu, it's one-of-a-kind. I can't blame the locals for selling it or the tourists for flocking to it. 

### Santorini's terrain is challenging.

Santorini, like much of Greece, is rough underfoot and hard to navigate. Even the paths in the most developed towns are cobbled and either go up or down; nothing is ever flat. It would be very difficult to be here if you aren't a strong walker, or if you have to push a stroller or wheelchair. High heels would be downright dangerous. 

I can't overstate the need to walk uphill. Our AirBnB advertised a "public parking lot only a few steps away!" This might be true if you consider 150 yards straight uphill "only a few steps". Also, that uphill walk is along the main drag through Megalochori, so you have to share it with cars driving through, and the inevitable caravans of four-wheelers; be prepared to jump into a doorway or press yourself against a wall as they pass.

### Santorini doesn't feel like Greece.

Santorini does not feel like Greece to me. Sure, the place is run by Greek people, but most of them aren't locals; the majority of hospitality workers appear to be transient, coming in March to work the high season and then returning to Thessaloniki or Athens or Patras in November. 

[Santorini Dave](https://santorinidave.com) (an actual expert on Santorini!) has posted numerous photos of taverna food that do look Greek, so I have no doubt there are excellent, genuinely Greek restaurants. But there's no way all those ingredients are local. This is not Embonas in Rhodes, where Manolis gathers eggs from his own hens and picks tomatoes and peppers from his own garden to put in that day's meals. Frozen, by ferry, from Athens is most likely what you get here.

### In Conclusion...

I know many love Santorini, and I'm sure it's a charming place if you know how to work it. But for my part--well, I kind of hated it. 

It feels artificial. 

Chris and I once spent an evening in the Swiss town of Grindelwald watching evening fall on the north face of the Eiger. We sat on our balcony, watching the lights twinkle on in the [Mitteleggi Hutte](https://www.mittellegi.ch/en/) and trying to pick out famous points on the [Eiger Nordwand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eiger)—the Spider’s Web, the Death Bivouac (“[…a welcome and unexpected luxury…](https://alpinevagabonds.com/the-eiger-north-face/)”. Climbers are crazy.) But we also watched the crowds of tourists below us on the Dorfstraße. Thousands of people walked past, joining the audience of a street concert or heading to the [Mini-Golf](https://www.facebook.com/people/Minigolf-Grindelwald/100057568355291/) across the street from [our hotel](https://www.booking.com/hotel/ch/grindelwalderhof-grindelwald.en-us.html?aid=356118&sid=326903f4d0c3e4fb21bf7188b7c2639e&dest_id=-2552301&dest_type=city&dist=0&group_adults=2&group_children=0&hapos=1&hpos=1&no_rooms=1&req_adults=2&req_children=0&room1=A%2CA&sb_price_type=total&sr_order=popularity&srepoch=1736916617&srpvid=f8b021feb93e0643&type=total&ucfs=1&#hotelTmpl). And no one looked up to admire the mountain, the starkly beautiful, dangerous mountain that was presumably what brought them to this crowded little town.

That's how I felt spending an afternoon by the pool with our fellow tourists from Washington State. They were happy, to be sure, but they were making good progress toward being drunk as skunks several hours before they were due to attend one of the most serious ceremonies in a person's life. They were happy to be in Greece, but they could have been in Mexico or St. Croix, or Destin, and not noticed the difference. That is not in itself bad; we all find fun where we see it. But if this is what Santorini is selling, I don't want to buy it. It's an awfully long way to travel just to get drunk. 

![Santorini is all about the cruise ships, stopping for a day.](images/IMG_3168.jpg)
