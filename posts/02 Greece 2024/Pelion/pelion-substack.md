# Pelion. Sept. 10–17, 2024

— Amy Hackney Blackwell

Our first multi-day hike was in the Pelion penninsula in Thessaly, northern Greece. 

![Map of Greece, with Pelion highlighted](images/pelion_map_overview.png)

Our walks went over and around the magical mountain of the Centaurs.

This was Trekking Hellas' [Hiking tour Mt. Pelion (Self-Guided)](https://trekking.gr/en/excursions/hike-mt-pelion-self-guided), a walk over and around the [Pelion](https://www.aroundpelion.com/) peninsula. Pelion is the ancient home of the centaurs, including the wise Chiron, tutor of Achilles, and the much more troublesome centaurs who broke up the wedding of Pirithoos and Hippodamia. 

![There's lots of centaur iconography in Pelion.](images/Milies_dryalos-hotel-sign.jpg)

We didn't see any centaurs; they might be extinct. 

## September 10: Arrival in Milies

We started the day in Meteora, where Chris lost drone #1 in the fog and drizzle and we drove the monastery roads in and out of clouds. But we couldn't linger; today was the day we had to drive to [Milies](https://www.travel.gr/en/experiences-ee/milies-a-stunning-village-emboying-the-essence-of-mount-pelion/) to begin our Mt. Pelion tour!

We headed south through the plains of [Thessaly](https://www.visitgreece.gr/mainland/thessaly/). Thessaly is flat and green. A light rain fell the whole way down the highway, which was delightfully traffic-free.

We left the A1 in Volos and drove straight through the city to reach the coastal road that runs down the west side of the Pelion peninsula, just feet from the water's edge. The gray sky and rain falling on the water reminded me of rainy days in Biloxi. 

![Detail of Pelion, showing our hikes](images/pelion_map_detail.png)

The [Pelion peninsula](https://travelthegreekway.com/what-to-do-in-pelion-greece/) is a major tourist destination. Every beachside town has a range of hotels and waterfront tavernas, with the accompanying tour buses.

Pelion is also famous for its mountain towns, and Milies is one of those. Our first foray into Greek hill-town driving began with a shock. We left the coastal road to begin winding our way up the serpentines. Just as we reached Milies, we came around a bend to find ourselves nose to nose with giant tour bus heading downhill. The road wasn't wide enough for both of us.

The Skoda was the clear loser, so Chris backed back downhill until he could get our car out of the way and let the bus past. 

Lesson 1: mountain town roads are effectively single-lane affairs but allow traffic in both directions. Be prepared to yield!

Lesson 2: Greek hotels don't necessarily come with parking lots. We left the car on the street out front for the two days we were in Milies.

We found ourselves the only guests at [Hotel Mirovoli](https://www.mirovolihotel.gr/en), run by the charming Anastasia. Once the rain stopped, our [room](https://www.mirovolihotel.gr/en/rooms/superior-double-room-fireplace-and-panoramic-sea-vew) had a view out over the hillside and the Pagasitic Gulf. We could see clear to Phthia, Achilles' ancestral birthplace. 

![View from Hotel Mirovoli](images/View_from_Hotel_Mirovol.jpg)

It takes about five minutes to explore the high street of Milies. We dined at a taverna with a charmingly handwritten menu, where the proprietor's 10-year-old daughter was happy to seat us and practice her English.

![Taverna menu in Milies](images/Menu_Milies_taverna.jpg)

We started the meal with a dish of pickled pistachio greens called [tsitsiravla](https://thewildepicurean.com/2022/04/tsitsiravla-pickle-wild-pistachio/), which we saw in Pelion and nowhere else. Chris will eat anything pickled, and these were a big hit.

![Tsitsiravla](images/Tsitsiravla.jpg)


The wild boar stewed with plums was succulent. Highly recommended!

## September 11: Milies&ndash;Kala Nera&ndash;Milies

> 11.3 km; 296 m (-296) ascent.

The day dawned bright and sunny, a promising start for our first hike. Anastasia served us breakfast on the porch outside.

Today's walk was an out and back, an easy stroll downhill to the seaside town of Kala Nera and back. We began by walking along the railroad track of the little [Pelion Train](https://www.hellenictrain.gr/en/pelion-train-mythical-route), which travels the narrow track that used to convey travelers from Volos to Milies. 

![Pelion train track](images/Pelion_train_track.jpg)

Now it's a fun tourist attraction.

![Friendly tourists riding the Pelion Train](images/Pelion_train.MOV)

[Kala Nera](https://www.greecemygreece.com/kala-nera/) ("Good Waters") is a pretty town with an economy apparently entirely based on tourism. We had lunch at a waterfront taverna &mdash; not that we needed lunch after our massive breakfast, and Anastasia had made us packed lunches, but there we were. 

Greek tavernas typically cover the tables with paper when diners sit down, for ease of cleanup. This one had particularly informative table paper featuring a map of the entire peninsula. It didn't make much of an impression on me at the time, but when I went back though my photos later I could clearly see the shape of our route.

![Tavern Pagasitikos table map](images/Tavern_Pagasitikos_map.jpg)

Lunch over, we hiked back uphill through sunny olive groves. 

![Olive groves between Milies and the coast](images/Milies_olive_groves.jpg)

Goats were everywhere, including this dead one that lay in the path:

![Did the centaurs kill this goat?](images/Dead_Goat_Milies.jpg)

The money-shot of this stage of the hike was the cave formerly occupied by the wise centaur Chiron, an hour or so up the hill from the beach. This is surely the way Achilles would've walked to school, after he and his dad Pelias sailed across the Pagasitic Gulf from Phthia, perhaps even landing at Kala Nera and enjoying a seafood lunch before heading up to Chiron's Prep School for Young Demigods. 

![Chiron's cave](images/Chiron's_cave.jpg)

We were now regulars at our Milies taverna, where we looked out over the terrain we'd covered as we dined.

## September 12: Milies&ndash;Tsagarada

> 13.21 km; 606 m (-429) ascent.

Yesterday we had the luxury of returning to the same hotel, so no need to pack up. Today would be harder. 

Milies to Tsagarada is a little over 11 km, or about 7 miles. The thing to know about hiking in Greece is that it takes longer than you'd expect to cover a given distance. An 11 km hike in the Alps would be considered an easy stage, almost a rest day. Seven miles in the U.S. would be a morning's walk, even on something rugged like the Art Loeb Trail. 

But in Greece? An 11 km hike can take you from breakfast til 3 pm, and leave you footsore and ready to collapse. The occasional 14.5 km hike can feel like the Bataan Death March. An 18 km day, standard issue Alps stuff, is basically unthinkable here. At least to me and Chris.

This is mainly a function of terrain. Greek trails are uniformly rocky and rugged. They're occasionally overgrown or washed out, and they're often hemmed in with prickly plants.  You can't take your eyes off the ground for a moment, lest you trip on a rock or allow the spiny burnet to have its way with your lower legs. Losing the trail and backtracking is common, as is the occasional bushwhacking or unexpected scramble.

So, Milies to Tsagarada! We took our leave of dear Anastasia and moved our car to the public parking lot next to our taverna, where it would await our return several days later.

![Skoda in Milies parking lot](images/Skoda_Milie_Parking_Lot_IMG_1718.jpg)

Then we were off.

![Trail marker](images/Milies_trail_marker_IMG_1723.jpg)

This walk featured lots of climbing. The trail is forested the whole way, white oaks and beech and the ubiquitous cultivated chestnuts. 

![Chestnut grove](images/Milies_chestnut_grove_IMG_1729.jpg)

![Green chestnuts](images/Milies_green_chestnuts_IMG_1749.jpg)

A [massive storm](https://greekreporter.com/2023/09/08/thousands-trapped-pelion-greece-floods/) passed through Pelion a year ago, downing trees everywhere. We had to climb over or under the trunks, which slowed our progress.

![One of many downed trees](images/Milies_tree_down_IMG_1744.jpg)

The open areas are now full of bracken fern and wild hellebores&mdash;it turns out hellebores are native to Greece!

![Bracken ferns](images/Bracken_fern_Milies_IMG_1735.jpg)
![Hellebore](images/Hellebore_Milies_IMG_1733.jpg)

The cyclamen were blooming; they were blooming everywhere in Greece throughout the fall. 

![Cyclamen](images/Milies_cyclamen_IMG_1751.jpg)

Cresting the ridge, we discovered the Aegean on the other side of the Pelion peninsula.

![Aegean viewed from center of Pelion](images/Milies_view_Aegean_IMG_1753.jpg)

We arrived in [Tsgarada](http://tsagarada.gr/en/) (2021 population 428) exhausted and ready to shower. Tsagarada's main claim to fame is a plane tree (*Platanus orientalis*) said to be 1,000 years old.

![Tsagarda's 1,000-year-old plane tree](images/Tsagarada_plane_tree_IMG_1762.jpg)

[The Lost Unicorn](http://lostunicornhotel.gr/en/home/) looks like it stepped out of the 19th century with its library full of actual books (!) and salon full of antiques. (The interior reminded me a lot of the charming but almost certainly haunted [Hotel Weisshorn](https://weisshorn.ch/en/home) in Switzerland. We stayed there doing the [Walker's Haute Route](https://express.adobe.com/page/ch9bK255ts5nY/) several years ago.)

Lucky us, a couple of tavernas were actually open for dinner&mdash;not something you can take for granted in small Greek towns in the shoulder seasons. 

![A cat joined us for dinner.](images/Tsagarada_cat_dinner_IMG_1766.jpg)

We ended our meal by sampling the local [spoon sweets](https://www.thegreekvibe.com/spoon-sweets-a-traditional-greek-dessert/), which are basically jams served in spoons. Very sweet! The proprietress topped that off with free ice cream bars&mdash;one feature of taverna dining is that you WILL be given a free dessert whether you ask for it or not. (In Crete, they add raki!) It took some time before we concluded that eating the unasked-for dessert was entirely up to us, and that we didn't have to finish them just to be polite. But those ice cream bars were actually delicious, and tiny, so no harm done!


## September 13: Tsagarada&ndash;Damouchari

> 7.2 km; 137 m (-586) ascent;

Waking stiff and sore is normal for multi-day hikes, but knowing that it's to be expected doesn't make hobbling down extra-large stairs any easier!

We ate our breakfast in the courtyard, attended by the Lost Unicorn's several cats and dogs.

![Amy and dog at breakfast](images/Tsa_breakfast.jpg)
![Lost Unicorn calico cat](images/Tsa_breakfast_calico_cat.jpg)

After another visit to the 1000-year-old plane tree, we were off to Damouchari (pronounced "dah-moo-HA-ree). 

![Amy at trailhead leaving Tsagarada](images/Tsa_trailhead_IMG_1236.jpg)

This was meant to be an easy hike, short and downhill, and we intended to make it even shorter by skipping the visit to [Fakistra beach](https://travelersanddreamers.com/fakistra-beach/)!). 

On the other hand, Anastasia back in Milies had mentioned that the walk down to the beach at Damouchari was so steep it left her legs shaking like sewing machine needles. 

Which sounded ominous.

The first bit of trail out of Tsagarada in fact easy. We quickly found a fountain where we could refill our water that was pleasantly unnecessary, since we'd been hiking for about ten minutes.

![These freshwater fountains are ubiquitous in Greece, though not always available when you need them.](images/Tsa_fountain_IMG_1777.jpg)

We emerged from forest to see a glorious view of the Aegean with the Sporades to the south. 

![The islands of the Sporades are visible to the right. I think we're looking at Skiathos and Skopelos.](images/Tsa_View_Sporades_IMG_1262.jpg)

Then it was time to descend. And the trail was ... steep. Relentlessly steep.

![Steep trail!](images/Tsa_CWB_steep_trail_IMG_1792.jpg)
![Chris contemplates the descent.](images/Tsa_CB_steep_IMG_1796.jpg)

![This kind of thing is on the border between walkable trail and ladder. It takes patience and strong legs!](images/Tsa_steep_trail_Amy_IMG_1250.jpg)

A side note on shoes: I wore my [Lems](https://www.lemsshoes.com/) Primals for the Pelion hike, partly on the thinking that this would be the easiest underfoot terrain. I loved their flexibility and lightness. Primals don't offer great protection from rocks and their traction isn't the best, which is why I switched to [Altra](https://www.altrarunning.com/) Lone Peaks for the other hikes, but they did fine for most of this hike. I quite liked them for this descent, in fact.

Chris wore Lone Peaks throughout. They've been his hiking shoe of choice for years and hundreds of miles through the Alps, Greece, and the Carolinas. Neither one of us will ever go back to stiff hiking boots with narrow toes. 

![Chris' Lone Peaks](images/Tsa_Lone_Peaks_IMG_1251.jpg)

![The unreasonably steep trail was redeemed by the view of the beach we were approaching.](images/Tsa_Damouchari_beach_view_IMG_1793.jpg)

We reached sea level at midday. We sat at the seaside bar to read and work until our rooms at the [Hotel Damouchari](http://damouchari.gr/index.php/en/accommodation-eg) were ready. (One reason we skipped the walk to Fakistra was that keeping up with work and blogs requires a fair amount of downtime. Shortening an occasional hike is a good way to maintain sanity.)

![The "Dancing Queen" scene from *Mamma Mia* was filmed here.](images/Dam_beachfront_bar_IMG_1802.jpg)

[Damouchari](https://travelthegreekway.com/damouchari/) is tiny. As in about 41 residents, which makes it extra-tiny in a region of tiny villages. But it's outrageously pretty, with not one but two protected bays and crystal blue, warm water. The vibe is chill. Aside from the wifi, our room could've been unchanged since the sixties, down to the balcony shared among all the rooms and secured with shuttered door panels. This is a trusting place.

![Sea kayaking is a popular activity.](images/Dam_beach_kayaks_IMG_1828.jpg)

The hotel is a family business. Dad manned the stove at dinner. The "menu" consisted of us walking into the kitchen to pick what we wanted out of several simmering pots.

![I like to get fish when I'm by the sea.](images/Dam_fish_dinner_IMG_1818.jpg)
![Sunset in Damouchari](images/Dam_sunset_IMG_1815.jpg)


## September 14: Damouchari&ndash;Kissos

> 9.81 km; 664 m (-217) ascent.

After a night somewhat plagued by mosquitoes, the morning dawned clear and warm. 

![Sunrise at Damouchari](images/Dam_dawn_IMG_1825.jpeg)

Breakfast wasn't served til nine, but hotel dad happily made us coffee to drink while we worked.

![Remote work has never been better!](images/Dam_Amy_working_IMG_1299.jpg)

Then it was time to walk to Kissos. 

Remember the super steep trail we hiked down yesterday? Well, the terrain doesn't change when you walk north… back up. Today's hike began with a nearly vertical climb uphill, and then another nearly vertical descent down to Agios Ioannis and the beautiful [Papa Nero](https://travelersanddreamers.com/papa-nero-beach-pelion/) beach. 

![Another super steep trail!](images/Dam_walk_uphill_IMG_1835.jpg)

![I believe this is a quince tree.](images/Dam_quince_IMG_1829.jpg)

![Papa Nero beach](images/Dam_Papa_Nero_IMG_1832.jpg)

The water called and I couldn't resist! 
![Pebble beaches hurt my feet.](images/Dam_Amy_swimming_IMG_1304.jpg)

Then we began the walk proper. Today's objective was to regain the altitude we lost coming down to the coast. (Somehow our voucher computed this hike as gaining 300 meters and losing 700, which seems unlikely since we started on the beach and finished in the mountains.) The salt dried stiff on my shorts, while my tank top stayed wet with sweat all day.

The hike was a mere 7.5 km, but my goodness it felt hard! It was supposed to take 4 hours, but it took us around six. We climbed and climbed. 

Chris ran out of water halfway through, but fortunately we could stop at a taverna and refill. 

![Badly needed break.](images/Dam_Water_Break_IMG_1837.jpg)

We saw more evidence of last year's devastating [Storm Daniel](https://www.cnn.com/2023/09/06/europe/greece-europe-extreme-weather-climate-intl/index.html). The trail petered out into a mud bank at one point. I scrambled up the tree roots in an attempt to get through, but it was not to be; we had to retrace our steps and walk up the paved road.

![Rocks washed downriver by flooding](images/Dam_big_storm_last_year_IMG_1843.jpg)

In the beech forests, I saw what looked like [beech drops, *Epifagus virginiana*](https://plants.ces.ncsu.edu/plants/epifagus-virginiana/). It's a bit of a puzzle because beech drops are root parasites on the American beech, *Fagus grandifolia*, and while these were growing on beech roots, they certainly weren't American.  This was the only place I saw this plant in Greece.

![Beech drops in Greece?](images/Dam_beech_dropsIMG_1846.jpg)

Chania (not to be confused with the city in western Crete), the location of our night's accommodations, was much too far to walk. Our trail finished in the town of [Kissos](https://www.aroundpelion.com/villages/kissos), another hill town that lay on the far side of a valley&mdash;and predictably at the end of a stiff climb.

We shuffled into Kissos at 4:00, with enough time to grab a snack at a taverna before our pickup at 5:00. We got a [horiatiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_salad)&mdash;I think we might have eaten horiatiki every single day of this trip&mdash;and a dish of sautéd sausage, tomatoes, peppers, and onions called spetzofai. [Spetzofai](https://www.dimitrasdishes.com/greek-sausage-peppers-spetzofai/) is said to be local to Thessaly, but it sure looks like a southern Italian dish to me. 

Right on time, Manthos, the young and energetic owner of [Manthos Mountain Resort](https://manthosmountain.com/en/) in Chania, showed up in the village square with our suitcases in the back of his SUV. We drove higher up into the mountains, the temperature dropping noticeably until we arrived at the ski resort, where autumn had unambiguously arrived. 

![A truckload of sheep; the Manthos family makes its own cheese.](images/Manthos_sheep_truck__IMG_1855.jpg)

It turned out to be a good thing we ate a big, late lunch. The hotel restaurant was closed that evening, so we walked into town to see what we could find. And what was that? 

Nothing! No restaurants, no grocery stores. The only place still open was selling local honey.

![Local honey in many varieties!](images/Manthos_honey_IMG_1865.jpg)

Chris made a dinner of granola bars left over from our bag lunches, and we whiled away the evening in our room watching *Mamma Mia* on a laptop.

![Our bedroom in Manthos Mountain Resort](images/Manthos_bed_IMG_1868.jpg)

![Moonrise in Pelion](images/Manthos_moonrise_IMG_1869.jpg)

## September 15: Chania&ndash;Mt. Pelion

> 9.07 km; 493 m (-499) ascent.

Greek hotel breakfasts are often a surprise. When there are just a couple of guests, the hotel won't assemble the usual breakfast buffet. Instead, the kitchen will put together dishes one by one and ferry them out to individual diners. And you never, ever, know what will be coming.

Manthos had self-service coffee, but otherwise we sat passively at our table while the waiter brought us bread, croissants, butter and jam in little bowls, pancakes, cake, a plate with two slices of cheese and two slices of luncheon meat, and finally a small omelet. No yogurt, which was unusual. 

The difficulty with this mode of service is that if you are at least trying to restrict your diet (I'm fairly strict low-carb), you don't want to eat something inappropriate only to have something you'd rather eat appear just as you finish. Also, there's the danger of just plain gorging.

Manthos' beautiful Serbian wife Elena drove us to the trailhead this morning. Today we were hiking around the [ski area](https://xionodromika.gr/en/ski-centers/pelion-ski-center/), up the slopes under the ski lifts and through the forests.

![Ski lift](images/Pelion_ski_lift_IMG_1885.jpg)

One can reportedly see the Aegean and Pagasitic Gulf simultaneously from Mt. Pelion (well, not simultaneous, but from the same spot). The first peak was overgrown to the west so the Pagasitic Gulf was invisible. 

![A group was setting up antennas to do long-distance radio transmissions from this peak.](images/Pelion_Amy_antenna_IMG_1309.jpg) 

But the Aegean was perfectly clear! We could see the Sporades, the three fingers of Halkidi near Thessaloniki, and if we squinted we could imaging that Turkey was visible. 

![Achilles used to come here to ski with the Myrmidons.](images/Pelion_ski_lifts_Aegean_IMG_1878.jpeg)

The trail was mostly through beech forests, quiet and soft underfoot. 
![Cyclamen](images/Pelion_Cyclamen_IMG_1900.jpg)

We took a break in a clearing that commemorates an accident in which several Greek Air Force pilots on a training exercise in a cloud crashed their F16s into the mountainside.

![Clearing commemorating F16 plane crash](images/Pelion_air_force_clearing_IMG_1892.jpg)
![Memorial plaque for air force pilots](images/Pelion_air_force_plaque_IMG_1313.jpg)

The inscription reads (the ranks of the four airmen are inscribed in modern Greek military epigraphic abbreviations):

> *In this place the airmen…*
> 
> Επισμηναγός, Major, I. Kommatas 
> Σμηναγός, Captain, A. Sioutas
> Υποσμηναγός, 1st Lieutenant, G. Antonōpoulos
> Υποσμηναγός, 1st Lieutenant, G. Loukoudis
> 
> *…sacrificed their lives for their county on October 14, 2004*


When we reached what we thought was the third peak, we encountered rocks and ropes and a scramble. 
![Who wants to do a high-altitude scramble?](images/Pelion_ropes_IMG_1898.jpg)

Assuming that this peak would also be socked in with trees, we decided to turn around there and head back down. Apparently we were mistaken. Had we just continued a few hundred meters further, we would've achieved the grand panorama we'd been promised. Oh well.

I called Elena as we descended to the ski lifts. She came to collect us, expressing some surprise that my phone had revealed us to be Americans. This area gets lots of German and British tourists, but Americans don't tend to venture this far afield either geographically or temporally. Throughout this trip, Greeks tended to assume we were German. We tended to say “Ja!” and roll with it.

And that was the day. We spent the evening working on our computers and eating dinner at the hotel, where we met Elena and Manthos' adorable two-year-old daughter Elpiniki (I think?). She's already pretty good at English, and also she likes kittens.


## September 16: Chania&ndash;Portaria

> 7.97 km; 41 m (-484) ascent.

My diary notes for this morning are: "Massive breakfast. Too many carbs. Never need to eat again!" Hmmm. 

Well, one can always skip lunch! We left our suitcases at the reception desk and headed off, hoping to get away before someone remembered to pack box lunches for us. 

This was our last day of walking around Mt. Pelion. We were headed back down and to the west, so that we'd end up on the same side of the mountains as our car. 

Early on, we spotted some strange looking apricot trees. Upon inspection, they weren't apricot trees at all! Someone had stuck apricots on the branches, and also left a scattering of apricots on the trail. 

![The oddest apricot tree](images/Portaria_apricot_tree_IMG_1905.jpg)

Is this some sort of bait? For hogs, maybe?

![Apricots on the trail](images/Portaria_apricots_ground_IMG_1908.jpg)

Storm damage was a factor throughout. Today more than any other we found ourselves scrambling and bushwhacking, making our own trail when the actual one was long gone.

![This used to be the trail.](images/Portaria_washed_out_trail_IMG_1960.jpg)

![Scrambling up a creek bank](images/Portaria_Amy_scramble_creek_bank_DJI_20240916061612_0053_D.mov)


The views of the Pagasitic Gulf were incredible, and we had the added pleasure of now knowing the landscape. It's easy now for me to see how ancient people could have a good understanding of real geography; they could see the shape of the land from the hills, and they new how it felt underfoot.

![View from Pelion across Pagasitic Gulf to Phthia](images/Portaria_view_Phthia_IMG_1913.jpg)

There's a protected wildlife area on the western portion of this trail, home to rare indigenous orchids and many spiky plants. I saw my first colchicums of the season blooming here.

![Colchicum](images/Portaria_colchicum_IMG_1940.jpg)

Herds of goats roam the area, kept in good order by their dogs.

![Dog leading a herd of goats](images/Portaria_dog_goat_herd_IMG_1944.mov)

Portaria (accent on the last syllable), like every other town in Pelion, is set up to delight tourists. Along with the ubiquitous local honey, this area is also known for fruits preserved in syrup.

![Fruits in syrup](images/Portaria_fruist_syrupIMG_1978.jpg)

We stayed [Hotel Kritsa](https://www.hotel-kritsa.gr/) in a room in overlooking the plateia, which is full of the plane trees that are such a feature of Pelion.

![Hotel Kritsa in Portaria](images/Portaria_hotel_IMG_1981.jpg)

Portaria is a decent-sized town, certainly bigger than any of the other villages we'd stayed in. It has numerous fancy restaurants and even has a pharmacy, where we bought dental floss and mosquito repellent. At dinner, we heard American voices for the first time since we'd arrived in Greece. 

![Snack at a fancy restaurant in Portaria](images/Portaria_snack_IMG_1967.jpg)

And... that was the end of Pelion! 

![I thought it was a fun hike!](images/Portaria_Amy_dinner_IMG_1987.jpg)
![Sunset in Portaria](images/Portaria_sunset_IMG_1984.jpg)

## September 17: Portaria to Milies, and parts beyond!

Among its other virtues, Hotel Kritsa has an EXCELLENT [breakfast buffet](https://www.hotel-kritsa.gr/breakfast/)! One would be tempted to spend the day working through it all. 

But! We had places to go. So we got in a taxi for the hour-long ride to Milies (only 22 miles, but the road winds down and then it winds back up), where our car awaited us. 

![The Skoda had a great view all week!](images/Milies_return_skoda_IMG_1989.jpg)

And then it was off to Kamena Vourla!

[By the Mallic Gulf, Kamena Vourla](images/kamena_vorla_boat.jpg)
