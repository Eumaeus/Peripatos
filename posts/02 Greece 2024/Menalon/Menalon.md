# Menalon Trail, September 2024

— Amy Hackney Blackwell

> Chris has already [posted a blog about the Menalon trail](https://eumaeus.substack.com/p/the-menalon-trail). This is a longer, day-by-day travelogue of the trip. The two posts should (we hope) complement each other.

The [Menalon Trail](https://trekking.gr/en/excursions/menalon-trail-hiking-tour-self-guided) put us square in the heart of the Pelopponesus, the heartland of Greece if Greece can be said to have a heartland. 

The Menalon Trail is a 75-km long hiking trail that makes a big loop through Arkadia. It's the first hiking trail in Greece certified by the [European Ramblers Association](https://www.era-ewv-ferp.org/) (ERA). The ERA is the organization that certifies many of the trails throughout Europe, including the [E4](https://www.era-ewv-ferp.org/e-paths/e4/), which we found ourselves walking much of October. Interestingly, the ERA does NOT appear to have certified the E4 in Greece, and even leaves a warning about a particularly scary section on the south coast of Crete that our Trekking Hellas guides also warned us against attempting! As I've said before, Greek trails can be rough and are not always well-maintained. So for the Menalon Trail to be ERA-certified is a big deal.

![The Menalon Trail in the middle of Arcadia.](images/menalon_map.png)

The trail was developed unter the [Elliniki Etairia, the Society for the Environment and Cultural Heritage](https://www.ellet.gr/en/), as part of their "Greek Paths of Culture." The conceit of the trail itself is that it passes through a series of towns that each have their own identify within the region of Arcadia - one specializes in metalwork, another in metal milling, another in stonework, and so on. The trail follows old footpaths that people used to use to travel from place to place. 

The [Menalon Trail](https://scottrogowski.com/how-to-hike-the-menalon-trail) is divided into 8 stages, but it's typically walked in five pretty long days. (Though [these people ran](https://www.timlloydphoto.com/adventures/the-menalon-trail) it in 3 days!) The stages are marked by arrivals into towns; some towns are closer to one another than others, and some don't have much in the way of accommodation or restaurants. As always, traveling slightly off the high season can mean that places will be closed and that lunch (or dinner...) will not be available when you want it.

The terrain is rugged and abrupt. The thing with mountain regions is that you might be only a mile or two away from a place as the crow flies, but a day's journey as the human moves. Just because you can see a place doesn't mean you're close!

So that's the Menalon Trail. But first, we had to get to Arcadia.

## September 20: Arrival in Stemnitsa
Restored by three days in a house in [Kamena Vourla](https://www.mitsis.com/en/destination/kamena-vourla), we packed up to head south. 

Our route took us back through Thermopylae and up and over the plateau of Mt. Parnassos, where we [hiked last spring](https://trekking.gr/en/excursions/delphi-6-days-ancient-hike-trail). We drove past the Unesco-listed [mer des oliviers](https://the-activists.com/product/ancient-olive-grove-hiking/?srsltid=AfmBOoq-bVktWKWkiPtWHxHEbdyAom2Y8ajBK70wbP7I7Xk16JVgZGAw) ("sea of olives," though that term evidently belongs to another [olive grove in Spain](https://www.oliveoiltimes.com/business/spains-sea-of-olives-unesco-application-moves-forward/117287#:~:text=The%20Sea%20of%20Olives%20is,vast%20expanses%20of%20olive%20groves.) that's trying to get UNESCO listing too) that we walked through on the way from Delphi. We stopped for coffee in Itea, where we finished last year's hike.

![Itea last year](images/Itea_street_2023_IMG_0379.jpg)

![Itea this year. The bank changed its sign, but the businesses are still in the same place.](images/Itea_Street_2024_IMG_2034.jpg)

Last year, we left Itea and headed back east to Athens. This time, we went west!

Driving on the north coast of the Gulf of Corinth, we passed Nafpaktos, where a couple of weeks earlir we'd spent a lovely Saturday with our friends the Coundoussias. 

![It's always fun to revisit places we've been before.](images/Gulf_Corinth_signs_IMG_2040.jpg)

Then we reached the bridge to Patras. 

![Crossing this bridge might be a once-in-a-lifetime experience for us; at €14.50, I wouldn't be disappointed not to do it again!](images/Bridge_IMG_1502.jpg)

After a brief section driving back east toward Corinth, we left the highway and headed straight south. Into the mountains.

The roads instantly became narrow, curvy, and steep. Autumn was starting, and the air cooled as we climbed. 

![We stopped for lunch at a cafe on the side of a mountain.](images/Pelop_taverna_IMG_2047.jpg)

![Like all tavernas, this one came with a cat. She likes keftedakia.](images/Pelop_taverna_cat_IMG_2057.jpg)

![We could see all the way to the north coast of the Gulf of Corinth, where we'd just driven.](images/Pelop_Tavera_view_IMG_2049.jpg)

Then we plunged into the mountains proper. It takes a long time to get anywhere in Arkadia! Though the distance was well under 100 miles, it took us all afternoon to arrive at our destination.

![Stemnitsa](images/Stemnitsa_IMG_2059.jpg)

[Stemnitsa](https://www.travel.gr/en/experiences-ee/a-wonderful-autumn-destination-in-greece-a-small-verdant-village-in-mountainous-arcadia/) is a village of red-roofed stone buildings spilling down a hillside with the requisite mountaintop churches. Stemnitsa is known for metalwork, especially gold and silversmithing. There's even a [school of silversmithery](http://grecorama.com/en/stemnitsa-silver-gold-smithery-school/) that attracts students from all over Greece. 

We spent the night at [Guesthouse Belleiko](images/https://mpelleiko.gr/en/) (or Mpelleiko), run by the lovely Mrs. Nena. (It's well worth reading the description of the guesthouse on the website. Sing, Muse!)

![Guesthouse Mpelleiko](images/Stemnitsa_Mpelleiko_IMG_2062.jpg)

That evening, we walked down the hill to grab dinner at one of the two tavernas. On the walk, I saw these bright yellow crocuses:

![Yellow crocuses blooming in September?](images/Stemnitsa_yellow_crocus_IMG_2078.jpg)

![Stemnitsa taverna](images/Stemnitsa_taverna_IMG_2088.jpg)

Our local contact, Stratos, joined us after dinner. He gave us detailed instructions for the trail, including water sources and the places known for aggressive dogs. He also gave us a dog whistle. And recommended that we carry a stick. 

![Moon over Stemnitsa](images/Stemnitsa_full_moon_IMG_2093.jpg)

## September 21: Stemnitsa–Dimitsana

> 12.5 km; 500m (-600m) ascent

Our hostess, Nena, is a culinary genius who supplements her hosting by teaching cooking classes. She filled our table with delicious things that I gobbled up, low-carb diet be damned! Local honey, ubiquitous in Greece, is especially addictive. 

Before we could begin our hike, we had to move our car. Nena told us to park it in a bend in the road next to some municipal trash cans. 

![Skoda awaiting our return](images/Stemnitsa_Skoda_parked_IMG_2095.jpg)

 Today's hike, [Menalon Trail Section 1](https://menalontrail.eu/en/activities/section-1-stemnitsa-dimitsana/?portfolioCats=21), took us down the hill from our guesthouse, back through town, and down to the famous Lousios Gorge. 

![Those ubiquitous yellow crosuses lined the path out of Stemnitsa.](images/Stemnitsa_trail_yellow_crocusesIMG_2104.jpg)

![Spanish broom on the hillside](images/Stemnitsa_Spanish_broom_IMG_2111.jpg)

![The Church of the Transfiguration of Christ sits at the top of the trail into the gorge.](images/Stemnitsa_church_entering_Lousios_gorgeIMG_2121.jpg)

The Lousios Gorge is famous for the monasteries nestled within it. The Prodromos Monastery, built into the very cliff face, is the money-shot for the entire Menalon Trail, widely used on websites. 

![The famous Prodromos Monastery, named after John the Baptist.](images/Stemnitsa_gorge_monastery_IMG_2130.jpg)

![The trail is carved into the cliff face, too.](images/Stemnitsa_trail_to_Prodromosmonastery_IMG_2127.jpg)

Many walkers stop to visit the monasteries, but you have to get there before they close for naptime in the early afternoon. I have very mixed feelings about using monastic havens as tourist attractions; neither of us is comfortable intruding on what is supposed to be solitary seclusion. On the other hand… the monks like the tourist €€, and it is their monastery. In any case, we arrived at the Philosophou Monastery on the far side of the gorge after they'd closed their gates for the afternoon, so the point was moot.

![Philosophou is on the other side of the gorge from Prodromos, which means more steps up from the river.](images/Stemnitsa_steep_up_IMG_2139.jpg)

![The trail goes right through the monastery when it's open, but we had to walk around it to pick up the trail.](images/Stemnitsa_Philosophou_monastery_closed_IMG_2141.jpg)

We took a break to eat Nena's packed lunch at a picnic table above the monastery, where we were joined by several monastic cats.

![Nena's amazing spanakopita](images/Stemnitsa_lunch_spinach_pie_IMG_2146.jpg)

We were still a long way from Dimitsana. The sky, which had been so bright and clear in the morning, turned cloudy. The clouds turned into a steady drizzle.

This section of the Menalon trail ends with a steep climb up to the town of Dimitsana, with walkers routed through the fabulous open-air [Water Power Museum](https://www.piop.gr/en/diktuo-mouseiwn/Mouseio-Ydrokinisis/to-mouseio.aspx#). Alas, we were too tired and wet to appreciate it fully. All we wanted was to reach our [hotel](https://www.baroutomilos.gr) and shower.

![Dimitsana in the clouds](images/Dimitsana_clouds_IMG_2157.jpg)

Dimitsana is set up to host thousands of tourists during the short summer season, with several tavernas built on the edge of the hillside to grab the view of the gorge. There are lots of shops selling clothes, jewelry, and trinkets. 

![A key chain that says Zoe!](images/Dimitsana_Zoi_keychain_IMG_2161.jpg)

We stopped to check out Stratos's girlfriend's jewelry shop; she trained at the Stemnitsa school of metalworking and now sells her own creations.

NB: The town's main road is also the highway through the region, which we drove the previous day to reach Stemnitsa. Our dinner was enlivened by watching cars of various sizes negotiate an alley barely wide enough to pass through. How the cats and dogs survive living here I don't know.

The rain continued through our sloppy walk into town to find dinner, but cleared up while we ate. This was the last rain we saw in Greece. The rest of September and all of October were dry as dust, so much so that I abandoned my raincoat in Rhodes.

Our hotel room had a feature we'd never seen before: the wifi was attached to the tv. So we couldn't log onto the Internet without also having the television on. We spent the evening watching a Greek sitcom that I'm pretty sure resembled *Friends*, along with numerous commercials for pasta and cat food.

## September 22: Dimitsana–Zygovisti–Elati

> 4.2km; 200m (-50m) ascent; **followed by** 14.9km 420m (-320m) ascent. **So…** 19.1km; 470m (-370m) ascent.

Today we did two official sections of the Menalon Trail: [Section 2: Dimitsana to Zygovisti](https://menalontrail.eu/en/activities/section-2-dimitsana-zygovisti/) and [Section 3: Zygosti to Elati](https://menalontrail.eu/en/activities/section-3-zygovisti-elati/?portfolioCats=21). 

Remember I said that the sections of the Menalon Trail are not all the same length? That was clear today. It takes about two hours to walk from Dimitsana to Zygovisti&mdash;hardly worth ending a day's hike there. But continuing on to Elati makes the hike substantial indeed. There was also the matter of Elati not having much in the way of accommodation, which meant we had to stay in Nymphasia, the end of Section 5. We left the hotel as early as possible to be sure of making our 5:00 p.m. pickup.

But! It was a gorgeous day! The air was clear after the previous evening's rain and the sun shone bright when it climbed up over the mountains.

We walked up through Dimitsana and over the first mountain of the day. 

![Sunny Dimitsana](images/Dimitsana_view_IMG_2168.jpg)

![With a view like that....](images/Dimitsana_valley_view_IMG_2171.jpg)

It was walnut-whacking season. Everywhere in Arcadia, old men were out in their walnut groves using long sticks to knock the walnuts out of the trees. 

![Time to whack the walnuts!](images/Zygovisti_walnuts_IMG_2178-720.MOV)

![Walnuts spread out to dry in the Zygovisti plateia](images/Zygovisti_walnuts_plateia_IMG_2184.jpg)

We strolled into the outskirts of Zygovisti around 10 a.m., where we were waylaid by the old man who runs a taverna of sorts right next to the trail. He welcomed us with his own fresh walnuts, which he could crack one-handed, and ice creams to go with our (very cheap) espressos. The town itself has a couple of more-developed tavernas, but this guy probably catches lots of hikers with his strategic position on the trail just before town.

![Looking toward Zygovisti](images/Zygovisti_cafe_view_IMG_2179.jpg)

![Fresh, free walnuts!](images/Zygovisti_espresso_walnuts_IMG_2182.jpg)

Then it was onward and upward (lots of upward!) for the much longer stage to Elati. I really loved this walk, which was very much a walk in the woods. 

![Walking in Greece always includes climbing.](images/Zygovisti_climb_IMG_2193.jpg)

![The Menalon Trail is exceptionally well blazed.](images/Zygovisti_woodland_trail_IMG_2201.jpg)

We kept seeing those bright yellow crocuses, along with some white ones. Crocuses are supposed to bloom in the early spring....

![What on earth are these yellow crocuses doing blooming in September???](images/Zygovisti_yellow_crocuses_IMG_2209.jpg)

Longer walks can be a slog. There's usually nothing for it but to keep going; Greek trails don't exactly have a lot of outs; the way "out" is "forward". The distance markers on the Menalon Trail tend to be quite accurate, which can be demoralizing.

![Four hours to Elati!!!!!](images/Zygovisti_sign_to_Elati_IMG_2195.jpg)

Remember, we needed to be in Elati at 5:00. I predicted an easy arrival at 3:45, though Chris was pessimistic. But by 3:40, we could hear music from a plateia that we couldn't yet see. Though we didn't make 3:45, 4:00 was no problem.

We spent our last hour sitting at the one taverna, eating pizza and drinking lemonade. Our driver, Panogiottis, arrived in his silver Mercedes at 5:00 on the dot and whisked us up the road to [Nymphasia Resort](https://www.nymfasiaresort.com/en/).

This resort is lovely, and it has a beautiful pool, but in the off season we were almost the only guests that night. The resort is located on the main highway, not in the town of Nymfasia, so we couldn't realistically walk to a local place for dinner. (Also, there weren't any local places, but we didn't know that yet.) We went down to the hotel restaurant for dinner, and discovered that we were actually ordering from the resort's sister restaurant in the town of Vytina. Greek DoorDash, essentially.


## September 23: Elati–Vytina–Nymfasia

> 5.6km; 110m (-310m) ascent; **followed by** 8.9km; 500m (-140m) ascent. **So…** 14.5km; 610m (-450m) ascent.

The girl who checked us in the previous afternoon and who oversaw our doordash dinner was still the only front-of-house employee in residence. There must have been someone in the kitchen, though, because they'd set up the entire Greek hotel breakfast buffet. I suppose the other two guests made this exercise worthwhile.

After breakfast, we took another taxi ride back to Elati, the beginning of [Section 4](https://menalontrail.eu/en/activities/section-4-elati-vytina/) of the Menalon Trail, which goes from Elati to Vytina. 

This was a relatively short hike. We reversed the end of yesterday's hike, walking past a goat yard and down into the creek bottom.

![Happy goats](images/Elati_goatyard_IMG_2214.jpg)

![I see why they call it Arcadia.](images/Elati_woodland_stream_IMG_2222.jpg)

The trail was easy enough, though as I've said before, they're never "easy." The day got hot, as they always do, and some sections were quite sunny.

![A sunny trail](images/Elati_exposed_trail_IMG_2238.jpg)

![Big mountains turning into smaller ones](images/Elati_mountain_view_IMG_2233.jpg)

We strolled into the town of [Vytina](https://greekreporter.com/2023/10/03/vitina-arcadias-beautiful-mountain-resort-surrounded-by-forests/) just before noon. Noon is years too early for lunch in Greece. Instead, we sat at a café and watched the local commerce.

![Vytina shop](images/Vytina_shop_IMG_2254.jpg)

![There are lots of properties for sale.](images/Vytina_for_sale_IMG_2245.jpg)

Vytina appears to have a thriving tourist industry based almost entirely on the sale of local honey and homemade pasta, with some hand-carved shepherds' crooks and bags of mountain tea thrown in for good measure. Tour buses pass through a seemingly impassible 90-degree turn throughout the late morning, bringing crowds of retirees to enjoy lunch in the fresh Arcadian air and buy pasta that they surely don't need.

![Pasta for sale](images/Vytina_pasta_IMG_2257.jpg)

![Beans and mountain tea](images/Vytina_beans_tea_IMG_2247.jpg)

The day's hike was also meant to include Section 5, Vytina&mdash;Nymfasia. You can hike a moderately long trail, OR take a very short walk on a dirt road. Our plan was to walk that hour down the dirt road (skipping the trail, on the thinking that we had the idea) and have lunch in the town of Nymfasia, which is down the hill from the Nymfasia Resort. 

Haha, silly us! Nymfasia is a ghost town, barely populated during the week, especially in the off-season. We had essentially walked an hour from the nearest restaurants and shops, and were still a good 20 minutes downhill of the Nymfasia Resort.

![An empty street in Nymfasia](images/Nymfasia_street_IMG_2250.jpg)

![The only life we saw was livestock and guard dogs.](images/Nymfasia_turkey_IMG_2252.jpg)

Back at the Nymfasia Resort around 1:45, we discovered that the front desk was now manned by a young man. He was happy to call a cab to take us back to Vytina, which was the only realistic possibility for lunch. He assured us that we could find a return ride at the taxi stand in the Vytina plateia.

Alas. We finished lunch at the start of the afternoon dead zone. There were no taxis to be had. After listening to the church bells chime two quarter hours, and browsed the honey-an-pasta shops (again), we called the hotel. The young man agreed to come collect us, which ended up adding 25 euros to our bill. Ah well… It's the off season!

The young man explained that his grandmother lives in Nymfasia, and he stays with her when he's working at the resort. The town does have a couple of tavernas in its center, but they're only open on weekends outside of the tourist season.

That evening, I solved the mystery of the crocuses! The yellow ones are [*Sternbegia lutea*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sternbergia_lutea), the winter daffodil/yellow autumn crocus. This information is thanks to botanists from the British Isles, who have long explored the flora of Greece and written about it in English. Evidently, the Mediterranean "spring" begins in autumn, when the rains begin after the dry summer. The first plants to flower are the bulbs. The Botanical Society of Britain and Ireland was actually sponsoring a [guided tour of the Pelopnnese](https://greenwings.co/our-holidays/botanical-holidays/autumn-flowers-of-the-peloponnese/) a few weeks after we visited the area. 

![Yellow fall-blooming crocuses, *Sternbergia lutea*](images/Stemnitsa_Sternbergia!_IMG_1416.jpg)

![The purple ones are *Crocus autumnale*, or colchicums.](images/Nymfasia_colchicum_IMG_2280.jpg)                                 

## September 24: Nymfasia–Magouliana–Valtesiniko

> 8.9km; 500m (-140m) ascent; **followed by** 6.6km; 110m (-220m) ascent. **So…** 15.5km; 610m (-360m) ascent.

This morning we were literally the only guests at the resort, so no breakfast buffet today. The young man who had helped us yesterday was still working solitary duty. He brought out our breakfast courses to the table one by one, cooking the eggs to order himself.

Today we were scheduled to hike two long sections: [Section 6: Nymphasia–Magouliana](https://menalontrail.eu/en/activities/section-6-nymphasia-magouliana/) and [Section 7: Magouliana–Valtesiniko](https://menalontrail.eu/en/activities/section-7-magouliana-valtesiniko/). It was going to be a slog.

We started out walking downhill through the town of Nymfasia, which added an extra kilometer to the day's stage. This morning we actually did see signs of life in the form of a few retirees and their dogs and cats. Or perhaps some cats and dogs and their retirees.

Out of town, we dropped down into another forest, with views of the luxurious-looking Kernitsas Monastery. 

![Arkadia is full of monasteries!](images/Nymfasia_monastery_IMG_2266.jpg)

We descended to the river, crossed the bridge, and then climbed steeply back up the other bank. 

![Woodland](images/Nymfasia_woods_IMG_2269.jpg)

![Bridge](images/Nymfasia_bridge_IMG_2270.jpg)

![The view back to Vytina and Nymfasia](images/Nymfasia_view_back_IMG_2282.jpg)

And then, somewhere in the "dense fir forest," we got off the trail. This seems to have been the result of some confusion with the GPX tracks, but we ended up walking through knee-deep leaf litter on a steep hillside paralleling the plumbing pipes leading between the next monastery and a spring. We climbed over and under downed trees, doing the limbo to avoid the worst of the spiky plants. A trail this was not. 

![Downed trees are so inconvenient!](images/Nymfasia_messed_up_trail_IMG_1531.jpg)

After an hour or more of this nonsense, we finally clambered back onto the actual Menalon Trail, just below the Sfyrida Hermitage. It was a relief, but we were somewhat discouraged by the distance we still had to cover to Magouliana, our mid-way stop. This section was supposed to take 3.5 hours, but we were past that already and still had a good hour to go. And I was demoralized from being overstressed and frightened by too many washed-out exposed bits of trail. And savaged by thorny plants. 

We finally caught sight of Magouliana just before 2 pm. 

![Just because you can see a town doesn't mean it's close!](images/Magouliana_view_IMG_2284.jpg)

The last bit of trail was basically a 12-foot scramble down to the road, which was seriously irritating.

![This dead frog exemplified my feelings about the hike at this point.](images/Magouliana_dead_frog_IMG_2285.jpg)

We had hoped to grab some lunch in Magouliana. Our first glimpse of town wasn't encouraging; everything was closed. But, Lo! Like an archangel bearing glad tidings, there appeared the distinctive silver hood of a Mercedes, the vehicle of choice of Arkadian taxi drivers. 

We flagged the man down, and he agreed to take us to our next stop, the name of which I had fortuitously committed to memory that morning: Valtesiniko.

I have never been so happy to have motorized transport as I was when we actually saw Valtesiniko, which has to be the steepest of the many steep mountain towns we've visited. Our guesthouse, [Thea Valtesiniko](https://www.thea-valtesinikou.gr), was at the very top of the hilly settlement. 

![Guesthouse Thea Valtesiniko is a mainstay of the Menalon Trail.](images/Valtesiniko_guesthouse_IMG_1541.jpg)

The footpath down into town itself was nearly vertical. We descended to eat a late lunch at a taverna with many cats and a very cute baby. 

![We were happy not to be walking that last section!](images/Valtesiniko_taverna_happy_IMG_2286.jpg)

To save ourselves the trouble of climbing down and up from the guesthose one more time, we then stopped at a grocery store to get supplies for the evening. Our room had a balcony overlooking the town, and those should never be wasted. 

![Sunset time in Valtesiniko](images/Valtesiniko_sunset_IMG_2292.jpg)

![Valtesiniko at night](images/Valtesiniko_night_IMG_2296.jpg)

That evening we tried to watch the movie *Troy*, thinking it would be a good history refresher. It was even dumber than we remembered, so we cut it off at the point at which Achilles raids the temple.

## September 25: Valtesiniko–Lagadia

> 13.9km; 500m (-700m) ascent.

There's nothing like dawn in a mountain town.

![Sunrise comes to Valtesiniko](images/Valtesiniko_sunrise_IMG_2298.jpg)

![The town in morning light](images/Valteseniko_morning_IMG_2297.jpg)

Today we walked the last section of the Menalon Trail, the lengthy [Section 8: Valtesiniko–Lagadia](https://menalontrail.eu/en/activities/section-8-valtesiniko-lagkadia/). This was another longish day, and there was no shortening it! Once we left Valtesiniko, there were no towns, and no taxis. 

It was a pleasant enough walk, though, hilly and forested. We were already at the top of town, which was a small blessing.

![I would worry about kids going over the edge.](images/Valtesiniko_swingset_IMG_2303.jpg)

![The source of all that local honey.](images/Valtesiniko_beehives_IMG_2306.jpg)

![Skull](images/Valtesiniko_skull_IMG_2308.jpg)

![Another glorious view!](images/Valtesiniko_view_Amy_IMG_1447.jpg)

This was serious sheep country. The flocks were on the move.

![Sheep scampering along a ridge.](images/Valtesiniko_sheep_herd_IMG_2325-720.MOV)

The walk did feel long. Chris was nursing an old stress fracture in his foot that started to feel sore that day, but there was nothing to do but carry on. At one point, we did sit down by a stream to have a little party; I'd saved a chocolate bar and some bits of cheese and happened to have a plastic bottle of water. Yay fun! (Don't knock it! It's important to tend to morale.)

![This turtle set about the same pace as us.](images/Valtesiniko_turtle_IMG_2328.jpg)

At one point, we were nearly knocked off the hillside by two giant dogs cavorting. They seemed to belong to a crew of Brits, but they denied ownership and insisted that the dogs had simply joined them on the trail and they couldn't get them to go away. 

One of the dogs galloped off with his new friends to visit parts unknown, but the other joined us for a kilometer or so.

![Chris and his new dog](images/Valtesiniko_dog_IMG_2330-720.MOV)

Alas, that dog was driven away by the aggressive sheepdogs tending a large flock of sheep.

![This little dog was the smallest and the fiercest of the three sheepdogs.](images/Valtesiniko_sheepdog_IMG_2333.jpg)

We climbed up and over a ridge to see our destination, [Lagadia](https://web-greece.gr/en/destinations/lagadia-arcadia-greece/). The air felt very clear and open on the hillside, much like the opening of *Sound of Music*.

![Just because you can see Lagadia doesn't mean it's close!](images/Lagadia_first_view_IMG_2346.jpg)

![Praying mantis](images/Lagadia_preying_mantis_IMG_2351.jpg)

After another hour and more of descending, we finally walked into town. We had finished the Menalon Trail!

![Lagadia, the promised land!](images/Lagadia_IMG_2352.jpg)

We had a very comfortable room in the [Maniatis Mountain Resort](https://maniatismountainresort.gr). We were the only diners at our taverna that evening. Most of the menu wasn't available, but the grill isn always fired up, and a horiatiki and grilled meat makes a fine dinner.

## September 26: Lagadia back to Stemnitsa, and Parts Beyond!
Lagadia is one of the most touristed of the towns on the trail. Our hotel had a couple of tour groups staying at it, more than enough folks to justify a full breakfast buffet. 

After breakfast, we dashed out to the road so as not to keep our driver parked; as per usual, stopping for riders means stopping in the street itself. This morning, Panagiottis' wife did the honors. 

During the hike, we'd occasionally toyed with the idea of getting a ride back to Stemnitsa to pick up the car, but that would've been a dumb idea. There's no place to park in any of the towns, driving through this region is a pain, and we still would've needed a ride to get the car at the end.

The Skoda was where we'd left it next to the trashcans. We climbed in and headed off.

First, we passed through the center of Stemnitsa and photographed the sign where our journey had begun.

Then we continued east, heading toward Sparti. We passed more fields of walnuts with more old men in Datsun pickups setting up to whack them. Then we drove out of the mountains, into the central plain, and back into summer.

## Closing Thoughts

The Menalon Trail is not easy. It's very well marked, so navigation isn't the problem. But the terrain is rugged, and the ascents and descents seem harder than the absolute numbers would suggest. Distances feel longer than one expects them to.

More importantly, there are not many outs. Unlike Switzerland, there are no cablecars to accelerate the ups and downs, or buses for the sections you just don't feel like walking. If you hurt yourself, it might be a challenge to get to a road.

You can't count on finding provisions along the way. Chris and I don't usually eat on the trail anyway, but sometimes a break is a good idea. Sometimes a little indulgence can make all the difference in morale.

[Trekking Hellas'](https://trekking.gr) arrangements were, as always, spot-on. Every hotel was extremely comfortable and hospitable. The route guides were great, even if they were often unnecessary on this well-blazed trail.

I find that I struggle to describe this particular hike. It was beautiful, it was well-maintained, and I would highly recommend it to serious walkers, but overall it was a mountain walk.

What I can say is that this is the week of this long trip in which I felt most immersed in Greece, and in a Greece that could've existed a century ago. Though I say the Arcadian towns are set up for tourists, they've got nothing on the really touristed parts of the country. The sense of isolation is real, and we spent most of most days alone. That sometimes caused discomfort, as when we couldn't find a place to eat or a ride to someplace else, but mostly it was a delight. So if you want to "discover Greece," whatever that means, the Menalon Trail is one good way to do it.
