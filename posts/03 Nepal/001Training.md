# Training. Everest Lodge-to-Lodge, April 28--May 9, 2025

We did the [Everest Lodge-to-Lodge hike](https://www.wildernesstravel.com/trip/nepal-everest-lodge-hiking-tour/) in the spring of 2025. (Well, technically, we were on the [Everest Private Journey](https://www.wildernesstravel.com/trip/everest-private-journey/), but the itinerary is basically the same) [Wilderness Travel](https://www.wildernesstravel.com) did a great job of organizing it!

A good time was had by all!



# Training: Table Rock State Park

It's a really good idea to train for the Everest Base Camp trek. A REALLY good idea. And the best possible training is hiking on rough terrain, ideally up and down mountains. 

Lucky us, we live 45 minutes from the perfect training ground: Table Rock State Park.
