# Everest Lodge-to-Lodge, April 28--May 9, 2025

We did the [Everest Lodge-to-Lodge hike](https://www.wildernesstravel.com/trip/nepal-everest-lodge-hiking-tour/) in the spring of 2025. (Well, technically, we were on the [Everest Private Journey](https://www.wildernesstravel.com/trip/everest-private-journey/), but the itinerary is basically the same) [Wilderness Travel](https://www.wildernesstravel.com) did a great job of organizing it!

A good time was had by all!

## Why this itinerary?

Everyone knows about the Everest Base Camp trek. This is the one where people walk all the way from Lukla to the actual base of Mount Everest, right under the Khumbu Ice Fall. Few tourists spend the night in the base camp itself; most walk there and back as a day trip from Gorak Shep, the last settlement on the trail before base camp itself.

But. The overwhelming impression I've gotten from reading numerous blogs and watching umpteen vlogs is that the last few days on the EBC route suck. People get cold, tired, and sick. The lack of oxygen (perhaps exacerbated by moving too fast?) really gets to them by the end. The accommodations are bare-bones and the food is increasingly monotonous. 

Chris and I really like our comfort. By that, I mean we would at least like to have a private room to sleep in, and ideally an en suite bathroom. We like to have electricity in our bedroom so we can charge our devices at night.

The teahouses and Sherpa lodges that are the mainstay of EBC lodging don't guarantee those things. The toilets are shared, in some cases a single squatty potty for an entire floor. The showers are down the hall and you have to pay extra for them. There might not be electricity. Many places have a charging station in the dining room where guests can pay to charge their phones. The dining rooms are the only heated parts of the lodges, so they can get crowded with wet, muddy, possibly loud-mouthed tourists. 

We don't mind toilets down the hall from time to time, but we don't relish a steady diet of it. Though I'm sure our fellow travelers are charming people, and I know that meeting people from other lands is part of the wonder of travel, especially mountain dirtbag travel, but Chris and I do like to keep our own company. And daily showers.

We really don't want to have to bunk down on the benches in the dining hall. It doesn't have to be the Four Seasons, but sleeping with strangers is a bridge too far.

The [Everest Lodge-to-Lodge hike](https://www.wildernesstravel.com/trip/nepal-everest-lodge-hiking-tour/) itinerary duplicates the classic Everest Base Camp trek up to Pangboche--which is the last place on the route where there are "comfort" accommodations. After a brief glance up the trail that runs along the river (the Dudh Khosi) toward Lhotse, Nuptse, Sagarmatha (aka Chomolungma, aka Mt. Everest), it turns back west toward the Sherpa settlement of Phortse for a relatively comfortable night at altitude before heading back to Namche Bazaar by a different route. This cuts a few days off the full there-and-back trek while also providing some variety in trails and accommodations. 

## The value of extra time: oxygen and sleep

The beauty of the private journey we booked was that we could tweak the itinerary to our own tastes. The first thing I did was add a couple of extra nights to the walk. First, I added a third night in Namche Bazaar.

Namche Bazaar is the main "town" on the tourist trail. This is the spot where almost all trekkers spend a couple of nights to acclimatize and do any last-minute shopping. 

The standard itinerary spends two nights in Namche. In my exhaustive pre-trek reading, I concluded that we'd give ourselves a better chance--both of avoiding altitude sickness and generally enjoying the trip--by staying there three nights. I have Ian Taylor Trekking to thank for this--they emphasize the importance of [sufficient acclimatization around the 12,000 foot mark](https://iantaylortrekking.com/blog/high-altitude-trekking-tips-for-success/), and the value of [three nights in Namche](https://iantaylortrekking.com/the-everest-region/sleeping-at-everest-base-camp/).

The normal Lodge-to-Lodge itinerary spends one night in Pangboche, during which trekkers can make an optional visit to Ama Dablam base camp. A visit to an actual climbing base camp that isn't a major tourist attraction seemed too good to miss, and tacking it on to a hiking stage (albeit the short stage from Deboche to Pangboche) sounded a bit too hectic. I added a second night in Pangboche, which gave us time to enjoy the walk from Deboche to Pangboche--you've never seen such stunning views of Ama Dablam!--and to spend a full day on Ama Dablam itself.

I also handled our own bookings in Kathmandu. Everest Lodge-to-Lodge ordinarily houses guests at the [Gokarna Forest Resort](https://gokarna.com). I wanted to stay near Thamel for our first weekend, both for shopping and to enjoy the Kathmandu vibe, which was a reasonable choice though I now appreciate why Gokarna would be ideal for "comfort" guests. I also wanted to spend a full weekend in Kathmandu before heading off to the mountains, both to breathe air at 4500 feet or so (it's not "high", but it's higher than South Carolina!) and to begin to get over the savage jet lag that comes with traveling 9.75 time zones. 

Nepal is nine (or ten, depending on time of year) hours and 45 minutes ahead of EST.

I understand why most itineraries fly people off to the mountains a day or so after they arrive in Kathmandu and why they don't linger in Namche. Vacation time and money are both limited in most cases, and it takes many days to reach Everest Base Camp in the best of circumstances. 

We, however, happened to have the luxury of an open schedule, so we took advantage of it. Whether it was a game changer, I can't really say, but I do wonder how much of people's difficulty sleeping at altitude is more a function of disrupted circadian rhythms than of altitude sickness per se. Certainly dashing straight to Lukla after a major international flight doesn't help with the matter of fatigue. We got tired enough even with our looser schedule.

### How thin is the air, really?

Thin. Not gonna lie, the altitude really makes things harder.

I noticed the lack of oxygen the moment we climbed out of the helicopter in Lukla. Walking through town to the Mountain Lodge felt alarmingly strenuous, though that could also have been jet lag and getting up at 4:15 a.m. 

I really felt the altitude during our days in Namche Bazaar. My heart was racing, I was breathing faster than usual, and I sometimes woke up in the night gasping for breath. It didn't help that my right nostril got completely clogged on the way up there, possibly the result of inhaling far too much donkey dung. 

Bala advocated wearing a buff over my face to keep out the dung dust, but that made me feel like I was suffocating.

Some people take Diamox to ward off altitude sickness. I didn't want to chance the side effects with a new sulfa drug, and I also didn't want to use a drug to mask physical symptoms that could be better addressed by addressing the actual problem, so we went drug-free. 

We just climbed slowly. That was always the solution. You can ALWAYS go slower.

Even when Bala declared us acclimatized and at no risk of any altitude-related difficulties, I still felt the lack of air. It wasn't until we flew back to Kathmandu that my heart stopped racing.

## How comfortable are the "comfort" accommodations?

Comfortable enough, definitely. Not Four Seasons luxurious, or even I-65 Comfort Inn luxurious, but plenty comfortable for our purposes.

We mostly stayed in properties owned by Mountain Lodges of Nepal, formerly known as Yeti Mountain Home. How I lament the change of name! 

The Mountain Lodges are great, some of the best places you can stay in the region. They all provide a high level of service, with happy hour before dinner every evening, plenty of hot water for drinking and filling water bottles, and generous meals.

The beds are comfortable and spacious, and they come with lots of covers. They also have electric bed-warming pads, which are great when the electricity is running. 

The rooms aren't heated. Hence the electric bed warmers/electric blankets. Nighttime temperatures dropped below freezing most of the time we were in the Khumbu (in MAY), which meant our rooms were darn cold. We appreciated pre-warmed beds.

The power was out several nights in Namche, which meant no warm beds. Bala had the staff give us hot-water bottles, which helped.

Most of these lodges advertise their hot showers. This should be taken with several grains of salt. To be sure, we had showers in our bathrooms. But the showers were heated with solar energy, and solar only works when it's sunny. At least half the time, it was cloudy, if not outright raining/snowing. The showers weren't very hot those days. Our third night in Namche, the electricity had been out for 24 hours and it had been snowing. We didn't even try to shower that day.

The hottest shower we had was in Pangboche. It was gas heated.

In Pangboche, we stayed at an Everest Summit Lodge, which was very nice. It has two categories of room, "comfort" and regular. It also has two dining rooms so the comfort guests don't have to mix with the riff raff.

In Deboche, we stayed at Rivendell Lodge. The newest Mountain Lodge has just opened in Deboche, so presumably future itineraries will stay there. Rivendell is more basic than the Mountain Lodges, more like a standard lodge; this was the only place where the dining room was actually full of guests. 

In Phortse, we stayed at a Sherpa Lodge. We shared a double room and used the toilet down the hall. No showers that day either.

Meals were excellent and plentiful. The Mountain Lodges served multi-course lunches and dinners and the staff would come around the tables with pots offering seconds of everything. Breakfasts were made to order; we came to favor the masala omelet. 

## Why Wilderness Travel?

There are piles of Khumbu Valley hikes available, at all kinds of price points. You can go [very expensive](https://climbingthesevensummits.com/ruggedluxury/). You can go super cheap, like this [Indian couple who traveled on $11 a day](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFC_Y-onfUMzU_PkSBmYeCL6tgq9hYBgB). Prices have gone up since Nepal instituted a guide requirement in 2025, although Bala told us that guides are still optional in the Khumbu.

The most bare-bones travelers just wing it, picking up a guide in Thamel or even Lukla and trusting that there will be space in teahouses on the way. At the end of the second-day walk to Namche, just the prospect of walking from the bottom of town to a booked hotel at the top is a daunting prospect; the thought of wandering from inn to inn like Joseph and Mary doesn't bear consideration.

They might carry all their own gear, though porters don't charge much for their labor. Cheaper tours come with big groups, with all that entails. Cheaper modes of travel also can involve more uncertainty about flights in and out of Lukla--one hears horror stories of folks being stuck in Lukla for three days, just waiting for a flight back to Kathmandu. 

The most expensive tours can come with luxuries like helicopter tours of Everest itself, or helicopter transfers from one place to another. Helicopters really add to the price, but there's no discounting the convenience of instantaneous transfers; lots of folks are happy to pay for a flight from EBC to Lukla when the only alternative is at least three days of (hard) walking.

Mountain Lodges of Nepal, which provided most of our accommodation, runs its own version of the [Everest Base Camp trek](https://mountainlodgesofnepal.com/journeys/everest-base-camp-trail/) with lots of helicopter transfers. Mountain Lodges also offers some thoughtful alternate options like the [Everest Sherpa Trail](https://mountainlodgesofnepal.com/journeys/everest-sherpa-trail/) that hikes as far as Deboche and includes a helicopter excursion to Kala Patthar and heli ride back to Lukla. This is not a terrible itinerary if your time is short.

We didn't want that level of luxury--we were there to walk in the mountains, after all. On the other hand, we did have a tight schedule, we needed to be back in Kathmandu on a specific date, and we do relish our privacy and our comfort.

[Wilderness Travel](https://www.wildernesstravel.com) hit the sweet spot for us. The Lodge-to-Lodge itinerary is all walking, there and back. We had a private guide who devoted himself exclusively to us, making sure we always had water and working his connections at the airport to make sure we got back to Kathmandu on time. He was one of the most experienced and smartest local guides, so we learned tremendous amounts just by listening to his lectures on culture and natural history. They also hooked us up with a local contact in Kathmandu; Pankaj got us through the visa process in mere minutes, ushered various family members to and from the (chaotic and mildly terrifying) Kathmandu airport, arranged multiple drivers with large vehicles, and even hooked us up with a dress shop on a Saturday. Wilderness Travel really did nail the balance between furnishing us the services we could actually benefit from and letting us handle ourselves as much as possible. No complaints there.
