# Everest Lodge-to-Lodge, April 28--May 9, 2025. Day-by-day.

We did the [Everest Lodge-to-Lodge hike](https://www.wildernesstravel.com/trip/nepal-everest-lodge-hiking-tour/) in the spring of 2025. (Well, technically, we were on the [Everest Private Journey](https://www.wildernesstravel.com/trip/everest-private-journey/), but the itinerary is basically the same) [Wilderness Travel](https://www.wildernesstravel.com) did a great job of organizing it!

A good time was had by all!


## The Beginning: Kathmandu. 

### The beginning: Kathmandu

Obviously everything started in Kathmandu. It's the only place to fly into Nepal, so nearly everyone comes in through there. (A few people travel overland from India.)

We left Greenville in the morning on Wednesday, April 23. We drove to my sister's house in Morningside, where we would leave the car for the month. We had a fun lunch outing with at [Farmburger](https://www.farmburger.com) in Virginia Highland and got rained on!

![We got to visit our cat niece, Amina!](images/Atlanta_Amina_IMG_5043.jpg)

Around 5, we grabbed an Uber to the airport (super great time to drive through Atlanta, haha) and checked in at the Turkish Airlines desk in the International Terminal. Our flight left at about 10 pm.

### Turkish Airlines FTW!

Our flights were extraordinarily easy. We flew Atlanta to Istanbul and thence to Kathmandu. Both flights left late in the evening, which meant we were mostly just asleep/sleepy the whole time. 

It's never easy to sleep on planes, of course, but flying late does make it easier. [This strap](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0758TY861?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title) was a game-changer; it holds your head against the headrest, preventing the sudden head drop that always startles me back awake when I happen to drop off. I also used [this footrest](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DRVS88XJ?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title&th=1). It was a little tricky to get it set up right in the dark, but it also made a big difference in comfort. Being able to relax completely is evidently the key to long-term dozing.

We had about four hours in Istanbul airport. We made the most of our brief visit to Turkey by having lunch (dinner?) at the nice restaurant in the [Cuisine Anatolia](https://www.istairport.com/en/services/food-beverage/restaurants-cafes/cuisine-anatolia-close-to-a-b-pier/?locale=en) section.

![This looks just like our daughter Zoe's cat, Winston. Alas, this wasn't the ideal time to shop for giant lego kits.](images/Istanbul_lego_IMG_5047.jpg)

We were given another dinner and another breakfast on our flight to Nepal, but neither one of us much wanted to eat more meals at strange times. The flight from Istanbul to Kathmandu took about six hours, which felt downright quick compared with the first 12-hour flight. 

### Friday, April 25: Arrival in Kathmandu

We landed around 6 a.m. Nepal time. (Nepal is nine and 45 minutes ahead of EDT. It makes conversions among time zones a little tricky.) At the airport, we were immediately greeted by Pankaj, our local representative who was to become a mainstay of our entire trip. He'd already put together the documentation for our visa applications, so we just had to hand over the $50 fee for each of us to get a 30-day visa. Chris had packed the cash in a ready envelope days earlier. 

Pan raced over to the visa desk, got in the one line with no one in it, and returned with our visas in about 30 seconds. He then walked us over to the employee/handicapped line in Immigration. We passed that in another minute or two. Pankaj then raced us to the security line we had to pass through to get into the baggage claim (Nepali airports have security checkpoints in many unexpected places) and left us to await our bags while he ran off to deal with some other arrangement; Pankaj greets lots of travelers, which means his days are full of coming and going at the airport. 

It took maybe 10 or 15 minutes for our suitcases to arrive; certainly it was faster than the Athens airport. We wheeled them out toward the parking lot, where Pankaj reappeared along with a driver. 

Our first short ride through Kathmandu was a treat. The traffic wasn't bad so early in the morning, so we could enjoy the women walking in their colorful kurti and saris and notice the tumble-down brick buildings that still hadn't been repaired after the [2015 earthquake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_2015_Nepal_earthquake). 

The [Hotel Shanker](https://www.shankerhotel.com.np) is old and elegant and hidden deep inside a compound enclosed in a solid wall. Pankaj left us there with a promise to return the next morning with our guide, Bala, for our full briefing.

![The Hotel Shanker used to be a palace!](images/Kathmandu_Shanker_Hotel_IMG_5053.jpg)

Our room was fortunately ready, so a porter led us up. The Shanker's elevators don't go all the way up to the top. To reach our room, we had to walk down a hall to the corner of the building and go up a narrow flight of stairs. 

The room was comfortable, albeit on the smaller side; this is to be expected in older buildings. We amazingly weren't tired, so we went downstairs to have breakfast in the spacious, sunny, and beautifully decorated dining room. 

Then we ventured forth.

Oh my, what a shock that was! Pankaj had pointed out the signs toward Thamel and told us it was just a short walk from the Shanker. Off we walked, full of confidence, only to discover that Kathmandu is not exactly a walkable city. People walk everywhere, to be sure, but that's because they don't have much choice. There are almost no sidewalks. There are no crosswalks. There aren't even any traffic lights. People just ... go. 

Pedestrians cross streets willy-nilly. In front of all the cars and motorcycles.

Cars and motorbikes turning right (they drive on the left) just turn. In front of all the other cars and motorcycles. 

Somehow it works. Everyone seems to be watching for everyone else, and makes accommodations. No one seems to get angry at being cut off. Everyone gets where they need to go.

But this first day, my heavens! The heat, the sun, the pollution, the noise, and the cars all over the place felt a bit much.

[Thamel](https://www.thelongestwayhome.com/travel-guides/nepal/kathmandu/guide-to-thamel-kathmandu-city.html?srsltid=AfmBOopfjSr6crqjL77GzyGylHDlmpLdIUhPjsSyBw95I8ghmwXEeZnw) is one of the main tourist centers of Kathmandu, where lots of backpackers stay before and after the mountains. I'd expected Thamel to resemble Khao San Road in Bangkok as I remembered it from the early 1990s (I know, that was a very long time ago, but it was my closest analog!). In other words, I thought there would be considerable foot and motor traffic but that there would be sidewalks or at least obvious places to walk. 

Thamel today is not a very hospitable place.

Don't get me wrong, the people are charming and friendly, and no one is actively trying to run anyone down. But the roads are narrow, and there's a lot going on there. Cars and motorcycles share the narrow roads with pedestrians. Walkers do well to keep their feet out from under the tires passing by inches away. Walkers also do well to avoid tripping on rocks or falling into holes. The noise, oh it was stressful, and it wasn't even 10 a.m.!

![A fairly calm moment of traffic in Lazimpat.](images/Kathmandu_traffic_IMG_5104.MOV)

We doggedly strolled the streets, looking at shops selling trekking gear and Nepali souvenirs. Touts tried to entice us into establishments. We accidentally wandered into the open-air butcher shop section, where we stepped over one half rat and one flat rat lying in the road.

An hour of this was enough. Unable to face the prospect of walking back the short distance to the Shanker, we caught a cab--it's easy to catch one anywhere, because the streets of Thamel are full of all types of vehicles--and had him drive us the five minutes to the hotel. It was totally worth the three dollars or so we paid.

After a restorative nap, we decided to head out in the other direction, down the sidewalk leading past the French Embassy. The sidewalk was great, though it disappeared for about 50 yards at one point--there is no avoiding the need to walk in traffic. Chris had found us a lovely restaurant with tables in the garden, where we had a civilized dinner.

![Our first dinner in Kathmandu.](images/Kathmandu_first_dinner_IMG_5054.jpg)

It was good to sleep that night!

### Saturday, April 26: Meetings and Shopping

After another wonderful breakfast in the Shanker's sunny and spacious dining room, we met Pankaj and our guide Bala in the lobby. Bala gave us an efficient briefing, full of essential details. He insisted on the importance of our (A) following his slow walking pace, and (B) hydrating all the time. He was pleased with the somewhat stretched-out itinerary I'd designed; he thought this would make it highly unlikely that we'd have any trouble with altitude.

Briefing done, Pankaj asked what we planned to do with the rest of the day. I said I needed to buy a lehenga for an upcoming party, but was a little worried because the shops were mostly closed on Saturday. Never present a problem to a guide if you don't want them to solve it! Pankaj phoned a friend who owned a dress shop, and half an hour later we were in Krishna Boutique, opened just for us.

Clothes shopping in Nepal is very different from shopping in the U.S. Many things are made to order. The shop shelves were full of partially made lehengas in the full spectrum of colors, with fabrics ranging from light silks and cottons to heavy brocades that would've made fine dresses for Queen Elizabeth. The FIRST Queen Elizabeth.

![The stacks of garments at Krishna Boutique.](images/Kathmandu_Krishna_Boutique_IMG_5056.jpg)

Many of the tops were just notional. The shop assistant fixed those on me with clothespins. 

It is hard to shop for garments when you can't see them on hangers. The owner and assistant pulled out lehenga after lehenga, piling them on the floor. I had done lots of online investigation of lehengas and other South Asian garments on websites like [Lashkaraa](https://www.lashkaraa.com) and [Kalki](https://www.kalkifashion.com), and I'd followed the [Ambani wedding](https://www.vogue.com/article/ambani-wedding-explainer) avidly, but without photos, I couldn't even indicate designs I thought would work. Some of the fabrics were extremely stiff and heavy. 

![The most comfortable design was an all-in-one dress in light cotton, but the color was too bright, and the style was too casual for mother-of-the-groom.](images/Kathmandu_Maddys_dress_IMG_5494.jpg)

Finally, the assistant brought out the perfect lehenga. It had long sleeves, which were suitable for my mature status. The skirt was a lighter weight cotton. It was comfortable, easy to wear, and elegant enough.

![My ideal lehenga](images/Kathmandu_Amy_lehenga_IMG_5484.jpg)

The owner called in his tailor to make the necessary adjustments: shortening the skirt and adjusting the top with a lower neckline and higher waistline. He promised to deliver the finished product to our hotel the next morning at 11. 

And that was more than enough activity for a day! We returned to the hotel for naps. We woke up ready for dinner and bed, but alas, it was only 3 pm. I sat out by the pool for a couple of hours playing bridge by myself. It felt like evening would never arrive.

![This wedding couple was doing a photo shoot by the pool.](images/Kathmandu_wedding_couple_IMG_5096.jpg)

The sun sets early in Kathmandu; it seems they don't do daylight savings time. In early evening, we walked out of the hotel and in the other direction from the previous night, hoping we could reach the restaurants around the Radisson through back roads. The good news was that we could. The sidewalks turned out not to be paved, and there were giant holes in the dirt that were best avoided, but at least we didn't have to walk in literal traffic.

![Kathmandu sidewalk](images/Kathmandu_sidewalk_IMG_5103.jpg)

The [Lazimpat](https://www.kimkim.com/c/neighborhoods-of-kathmandu) neighborhood in Kathmandu has some great restaurants with very reasonable prices. ATMs are plentiful, and we never had much difficulty in acquiring cash. Many places will take credit cards, but you can't always count on that.

### Sunday, April 27: Thamel again!

Today we ventured back into Thamel. We needed nalgene bottles, and it had dawned on me that our luggage would be moving around the Khumbu region on a man's or donkey's back, rain or shine. We'd brought big duffel bags from the U.S., but they weren't waterproof. It seemed that this might be worth addressing.

Thamel wasn't nearly as intimidating this time. We were starting to get the hang of crossing Nepali streets. The technique is simple: you just cross. Ideally, you watch for a break in the traffic, and it's never wise to step directly in front of a moving car, but if people waited for traffic to stop completely, they'd never cross at all. Or turn across traffic. We also added our own spin on the process by looking for human shields. We figured the crossing along with confident Nepalis would dramatically increase our chances of survival.

Thamel is full of gear shops selling North Face and North Fake products. It was the North Fake that we wanted. You can find waterproof duffels in a range of bright colors and sizes, so it wasn't difficult to get a couple of bags; that set us back about $30. Nalgene bottles are also widely available in genuine and copycat models. We bought knockoffs for a few dollars each, and then we were set.

![This is how our North Fake duffels traveled around the mountains.](images/NorthFake_IMG_5671.jpg)

We were back to the hotel in plenty of time for our meetup with Krishna Boutique, but he didn't show. After sitting around for a good hour, Chris What's Apped Pankaj. Pan, bless him, was on it. He went over to the shop, learned that the tailor hadn't returned the lehenga, and waited around until the work was done. Then he came with the owner of the boutique to deliver the item.

We'd also agreed to buy the hot pink dress I'd tried on the previous day for my sister to wear when she arrived for the wedding. I paid for it then, and Pankaj promised to hand the dress to her (altered to her measurements, which she emailed) when he met her at the Kathmandu airport two weeks in the future. This actually happened!

That afternoon, we packed. We were flying to the mountains early the next morning, so we had to have our gear duffels and daypacks ready to go. We were also staying at a different hotel when we returned from the mountains, so we had to move our suitcases to the next location.

![Helicopters limit each passenger's luggage to 15 kg, total - duffel plus daypack. As you can see, they're not very big....](images/Lukla_helicopter_IMG_5162.jpg)

It's not easy getting total luggage down to 15 kg! Chris kept running downstairs with duffels and backpacks to weigh them on the hotel's scale. In the end, he had to leave behind his largest battery. 

Duffels packed, we packed up our other suitcases. Our laptops and nice clothes, new lehenga included, all had to stay behind in Kathmandu while we trekked. 

It had started raining. We enjoyed the drive through Lazimpat up to the Ring Road, though the Ring Road itself was intimidating. The entrance to the Ramada Dhumbarahi was beyond a dirt road and massive market, but the hotel itself was modern and well-appointed. The desk agent was happy to store our bags for us to await our return. Then it was back into the cab to reverse the drive back to the Shanker.

The rain had stopped, so we ventured back out to our favored restaurant area in Lazimpat. It's really quite a nice walk through what appear to be wealthy residential neighborhoods. That evening, we dined at [Piano Piano](https://nomad.com.np/piano-piano-italian-restaurant-in-kathmandu), an Italian restaurant in the [Nomad Hotel](https://nomad.com.np). 

They made a great pizza and pan-seared trout along with a lovely artichoke salad, and I enjoyed a Nepali white. Nepal's wine industry is still in its infancy, but its geography should lend itself to decent viticulture.

![Excellent Italian cuisine in Kathmandu!](images/Kathmandu_pianopiano_IMG_5109.jpg)

Back at the Shanker for our last night, we went to bed early. We were headed to the mountains in the morning!

## Day 1: Kathmandu, Lukla, Phakding. Everest Lodge-to-Lodge, April 28--May 9, 2025

We did the [Everest Lodge-to-Lodge hike](https://www.wildernesstravel.com/trip/nepal-everest-lodge-hiking-tour/) in the spring of 2025. (Well, technically, we were on the [Everest Private Journey](https://www.wildernesstravel.com/trip/everest-private-journey/), but the itinerary is basically the same) [Wilderness Travel](https://www.wildernesstravel.com) did a great job of organizing it!

A good time was had by all!



### April 28: Kathmandu--Lukla--Phakding

![We flew in a helicopter painted like a dragon!](images/Airport_helicopter_IMG_5119.jpg) 

Pan said he'd pick us up at the Shanker Hotel at 5:15. We'd set alarms to go off at 4:45, but we didn't need them. I woke up at 4:15 and just lay in bed for a while thinking, "Wow, we're going to see Everest today!" That was exciting.

Pankaj met us in the hotel lobby and spirited us to the airport, a drive that only took ten minutes at that time of day. Though we had said we didn't need them, the hotel had packed us box breakfasts. Bala was waiting for us there. We went through the initial security check (you can't enter a Nepali airport without a ticket and going through an x-ray machine) and then the regular security check. We weighed ourselves and bags at the [Fishtail Air](https://www.fishtailair.com) counter, drove out to the helicopter pad, and we were off!

![The domestic airport is pretty chill early in the morning. Most flights to the mountains leave from Ramenchap instead.](images/Airport_Fishtail_IMG_5113.jpg)

![The guys loaded a bunch of bags of rice and stuff onto the helicopter with us.](images/Airport_helicopter_loading_IMG_5122.jpg)

![And we were off above Kathmandu!](images/Helicopter_Kathmandu_view_IMG_5128.jpg)

![We flew close enough to see the dirt roads and paths crisscrossing the hillsides.](images/Helicopter_view_IMG_5132.jpg)

![Chris carefully followed the no photography instruction.](images/Helicopter_landing_IMG_5157.jpg)

Our destination was Lukla, allegedly the most dangerous airport in the world. Bala insists there is no crash evidence to support this claim.

In any case, because we landed at the helipad, we didn't have to use the short, slanted runway, designed to use a slope to make up for the distance runways usually provide to allow planes to accelerate and decelerate.

![And there we were in Lukla! ](images/Lukla_helipad_IMG_5160.jpg)

![It was still early morning. The main street of town was mostly deserted.](images/Lukla_main_street_IMG_5164.jpg)

The first thing I noticed was the cold. It was mid-40s. The second thing I noticed was the smell of donkey pee. The third thing I noticed was the mud. And then I realized it was really hard to breathe.

Bala led us slowly through town on Lukla's main street to the Mountain Lodge so that he could organize his paperwork and hand off our bags to our porter, Mila Dai. We gave Mila our breakfast boxes, too. 

The lodge is beautifully situated on the edge of town--with its entrance up about 50 steps. We made it to the top, where I collapsed at a coffee table. I briefly wondered if we'd just made a terrible error coming to this strange cold place--would it all be awful and breathless?

It would not. Several cups of hot tea with sugar later, I felt more normal. Maybe it was just jet lag.

The initial walking wasn't bad. Bala walked slowly, and the morning's journey took us downhill. 

![Walking back down the stairs from the Mountain Lodge in Lukla. Our porter Mila led the way, followed by Bala and then Chris. That was the last we saw of Mila that day.](images/Lukla_leaving_YMH_IMG_5169.jpg)

![We passed numerous giant stones carved with Buddhist mantras. This one says "Om mane padme hum."](images/Lukla_mantra_IMG_5187.jpg)

![These stupas are everywhere.](images/Phakding_trail_stupa_IMG_5200.jpg)

Primroses (cultivated) and rhododendrons (wild) were in bloom everywhere. 

It was cloudy. Though there must have been high mountains all around us, the visible scenery was restricted to the river below us and grey mist just above.

![Misty Phakding](images/Phakding_from_above_IMG_5256.jpg)

We reached the [Mountain Lodge in Phakding](https://mountainlodgesofnepal.com/lodges/phakding-lodge/) at lunchtime. This was our first Mountain Lodge meal, and it gave us our first inkling that we might not lose weight on this trek. The Mountain Lodges don't do "light" meals--multiple courses and desserts are the rule. 

![The day's menu.](images/Phakding_menu_IMG_5237.jpg)

![Chris and Bala relaxing over tea in the lobby.](images/Phakding_lobby_IMG_5238.jpg)

![You could still see where the Yeti Mountain Home sign used to be.](images/Phakding_yeti_mtnhome_IMG_5233.jpg)

Our room was in a separate building from the dining hall. This presented a shoe problem. We removed our hiking shoes when we arrived at lunchtime, the better to keep mud and dirt out of the living quarters. This is customary practice at almost all mountain lodges. Everyone's outside shoes sit in little cubbies while their inside. The lodges keep an assortment of crocs for guests to wear in the buildings--some fit better than others, though I almost always found a pair in my size. But then we had to walk outside through the lodge grounds to reach our accommodations. 

After lunch, Bala took us on a short walk up the mountainside above the lodge--our first "walk high, sleep low" acclimatization hike. He started teaching us to recognize the songs of various birds; the laughing thrush was singing up a storm as we climbed.

![We visited the local schoolyard.](images/Phakding_school_IMG_5245.jpg)

![The buckweat was starting to ripen.](images/Phakding_buckwheat_IMG_5251.jpg)

It was starting to rain, so we abandoned our more ambitious plan to visit a monastery further away and went back to the lodge for a nap.

![Donkeys in Phakding](images/Phakding_donkeys_IMG_5202.MOV)

Bala advised us to shower that afternoon, when the solar water heating system was most likely to contain hot water. The water here was hot enough--not hot, but warm enough not to be uncomfortable. The bathroom itself reminded me of the painted wood facilities at U.S. summer camps and national parks.

The Mountain Lodges always offer at Happy Hour featuring rum punch (it used to be called "Yeti punch," but Corporate has evidently ordered the servers no longer to use that name) with baskets of popcorn and shrimp crisps. Bala allowed us one cup of Yeti punch in the evenings but otherwise strongly discouraged any consumption of alcohol at high elevations. (He assured us that after the trek, we could "swim in whiskey" if we so desired.)


The stoves initially felt great in the cold room but quickly became quite hot. 

At dinner, there were only two other guests with their guide. They'd just flown in from Houston and were doing a more rapid trek to Everest Base Camp; they were splurging on a helicopter ride from EBC back to Kathmandu at the end. 

This was our first night in a cold room. The hotel had turned on our bed warmers before we arrived that afternoon, and they made climbing into bed very comfortable. Bala had advised us to turn them off before going to sleep lest we wake up overheated, which was a smart plan. 

It was quiet and dark. We slept well.

## Day 2: Phakding to Namche. 

We did the [Everest Lodge-to-Lodge hike](https://www.wildernesstravel.com/trip/nepal-everest-lodge-hiking-tour/) in the spring of 2025. (Well, technically, we were on the [Everest Private Journey](https://www.wildernesstravel.com/trip/everest-private-journey/), but the itinerary is basically the same) [Wilderness Travel](https://www.wildernesstravel.com) did a great job of organizing it!

A good time was had by all!

Our first full day of hiking. The Big Climb!

### April 29: Phakding--Namche Bazaar

![Good morning, mountains!](images/Phakding_good_morning_IMG_5263.jpg)

This was a hard day! No two ways about it. Most trekkers agree that the climb up to Namche is one of the bigger challenges on the EBC, if only because it's the first big ascent and it happens before anyone is remotely acclimatized.

It didn't start that badly, though. The morning was bright and sunny, and we got our first views of big mountains, though the snow-capped peaks still hid coyly in the clouds. I felt energetic.

![A sunny, albeit chilly, dining room at the Phakding Mountain Lodge.](images/Phakding_dining_room_IMG_5265.jpg)

Bala encouraged us to try Nepali porridge at breakfast--tastes like any oatmeal. He also ordered us masala omelets, which are delicious and became our breakfast of choice. We also favor the local yogurt, though Bala worried it would disagree with our stomachs.

The morning walk to Monjo gave us our first experience of "Nepali flat," which isn't flat at all, but involves lots of climbing up and down to stay at more or less the same elevation. 

![The views of the mountains before noon were stupendous, and that was only a taste of days to come.](images/Phakding_trail_mountainview_IMG_5307.jpg)

![This is how much of the Khumbu is powered.](images/Phakding_donkeys_gas_IMG_5303.MOV)

![Red rhododendrons are everywhere.](images/Monjo_rhododendron_IMG_5363.jpg)

Monjo is a nice little town. Its name means "magic woman." The [Mountain Lodge](https://mountainlodgesofnepal.com/lodges/monjo-lodge/) there is beautifully situated. We ate lunch on the lawn, overlooking the sunny field where the lodge grows lots of its own organic veggies.

![Coming into Monjo.](images/Monjo_IMG_5337.jpg)

![Monjo Mountain Lodge.](images/Monjo_lodge_IMG_5342.jpg)

![Lunch on the lawn.](images/Monjo_lunch_IMG_5349.jpg)

![These monks were painting the mantra stone just outside the lodge. They were just finishing it up when we returned over a week later.](images/Monjo_mantra_painting_IMG_5344.jpg)

Then it was time to enter Sagarmatha National Park, where the trekking gets real. 

Bala got our permits at the office at the gate, and then we entered the park. There are guards who, theoritically, can search your stuff to make sure you don't have drones. Maybe because we were with Bala, we were unmolested. Chris had not elected to bring his drone, because his reading of the bureaucratic requirements were so daunting. But not that we know Pankaj, next time we'll get the drone permit. 

![The famous gateway.](images/Monjo_Sagarmatha_IMG_5359.jpg)

I did not feel energetic after lunch. Part of it no doubt was the lunch--several courses midday is not what I normally choose if I can't take a nap right after--and part of it was surely the jet lag that we were still very much not over. No matter, it was time to walk! 

The first part of this stretch is a flat bit along the Dudh Khosi, crossing over to one side and back to the other.

![We passed through the "town" of Jorsalle, whose name means "two pines."](images/Jorsalle_IMG_5373.jpg)


Then we had to climb up to the Hillary Bridge. The path next to the river had been washed out, so some of the walking was on new "trails" carved into the loose dust on the hillside. Not our favorite footing! Bala promised to take us back to Monjo by the higher trail that the donkey trains use.

![We got our first view of the famous Hillary Bridge.](images/Hillary_bridge_approach_IMG_5390.jpg)

There are two Hillary Bridges, a high new one and an old lower one. Until recently, those trekkers who found high suspension bridges distastefully scary could cross on the lower bridge, albeit at the cost of about 45 minutes of extra climbing. No longer. Now, that bridge has been taken over by a bungee jumping establishment. 

![The bunjee bridge.](images/Hillary_bridge_bunjee_IMG_5407.jpg)

Some lament the touristification of the trail, but I don't know; the bridge is there, somebody can make money off jumpers, and it's not as if this facility alone is going to increase numbers. Everyone still has to walk.

The Hillary Bridge is something of a tourist attraction in itself. Lots of trekkers try to claim it briefly to shoot their selfies and videos. I imagine that gets annoying in high season, though we didn't mind taking a short break to watch the donkey trains and eat some of the "magic candy" Bala produced from his bag. 

![You have to wait for the donkeys to finish crossing before starting.](images/Hillary_bridge_donkeys_IMG_5404.jpg)

![The view from the bridge; it IS really high! But there's a great view of the way back to Monjo.](images/Hillary_bridge_film_IMG_5408.MOV)

After the bridge, everyone climbs. And climbs. Every blogger mentions this climb, which goes on for hours. It took us about two hours to reach the next national park checkpoint, and we still weren't to Namche. Bala kept us at our slow, slow pace. It got harder to breathe.

![The stairs right after the bridge are new concrete structures.](images/Hillary_bridge_concrete_stairs_IMG_5422.jpg)

The trails here are all very well maintained, and on this stretch we saw some of this maintenance in action. A large section of trail was blocked off while workers chiseled and hammered new rocks into place. Porters carried rocks to the work on their backs.

My heart sank when I saw the crowds lined up at the checkpoint just before Namche, but Bala told us to just go sit down and wait. He proceeded to walk right up to the window, where he handled our paperwork in seconds while the polyglot hordes behind him milled about in confusion. 

These checkpoints appear from time to time. They're partly to make sure everyone pays the entrance fee, and I suppose also to make sure everyone who goes in comes back out again. But given the language problems--Germans, Indians, Japanese, Chinese, Poles, etc. all trying to communicate in English with Nepali staff--there must be plenty of folks who miss them or skip them.

By the last stage of the trail, we were very tired indeed. My right nostril had clogged up, perhaps a cold or perhaps the manifestation of an allergy to donkey dung. We were breathing hard, slow pace uphill notwithstanding.

![We're there, but still at the bottom of town!](images/Namche_arrival_IMG_5443.jpg)

We finally arrived at the iconic entrance to Namche Bazaar, with the famous line of prayer wheels lined up on the right. 

![People spin these prayer wheels as they walk past. You must pass on the left.](images/Namche_entering_IMG_5539.MOV)

But the [Mountain Lodge](https://mountainlodgesofnepal.com/lodges/namche-lodge/) here is at the very top of town, so there was more climbing still to do. Bala says many of his clients think this is the worst part.

![We finally made it up to the Mountain Lodges of Nepal Namche, formerly known as Yeti Mountain Home.](images/Namche_lodge_IMG_6712.jpg)

![The Namche lodge is super popular and super hospitable. Very comfortable rooms!](images/Namche_lodge_entrance_IMG_5549.jpg)

At the lodge, we removed our donkey-dung-dirty shoes, donned our crocs, and sat in the lobby for a cup of tea. It was past 5:30, so clearly happy hour wasn't in the cards for us this evening. We gave our dinner orders at the front desk and then repaired to our chamber to freshen up.

Bala had gotten the lodge to give us one of the two best rooms, on the end with windows in two walls. He once again counseled us to use the showers right away, before a bigger group checked in and sucked up all the hot water.

Before dinner, we handed over some clothes for washing. This hotel was one of the few places that both offered laundry service and would have enough time to get it done.

Dinner was good, warm and plentiful. Tonight was chili con carne. We went straight to bed afterward and were asleep by 8:30.

## Days 3–4: Namche and Environs.

We did the [Everest Lodge-to-Lodge hike](https://www.wildernesstravel.com/trip/nepal-everest-lodge-hiking-tour/) in the spring of 2025. (Well, technically, we were on the [Everest Private Journey](https://www.wildernesstravel.com/trip/everest-private-journey/), but the itinerary is basically the same) [Wilderness Travel](https://www.wildernesstravel.com) did a great job of organizing it!

A good time was had by all!

Acclimitization day, and disappointing power-outage!

### April 30--May 1: Namche Bazaar

![Chris and Amy having a good time in Namche Bazaar!](images/Namche_us_IMG_5501.jpg)

We spent three nights in Namche Bazaar. It's customary to spend two nights there to acclimatize, but [Ian Taylor Trekking recommends three](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DJ1sqdEu6m8/). It also seemed like we'd appreciate a little downtime. This was a good choice.

### April 30: Around Namche

![Oh what a beautiful morning!](images/Namche_good_morning_IMG_5446.jpg)

Bala had said we could sleep late today, but it was not to be. True to form, we were up around 5:00.

My nose was running. I NEVER get colds, not since I switched to a low-carb diet years ago. This was very annoying! 

The power seemed to have gone out in the night. We assumed that the hotel had just turned off the electricity overnight (a common practice in mountain huts) and would turn it back on before breakfast.

No such luck. The turbines of the hydropower plant that supplied the whole region had gotten silted up. A hydro expert was traveling from Kathmandu to fix them. There was no telling when the electricity would be back--maybe tomorrow?

![I went down to the dining room early and drank several cups of tea while reading my ipad.](images/Namche_Amy_breakfast_ip16-IMG_5908.jpg)

That morning, Bala took us up to the Everest viewpoint just above the mountain lodge. It's only a five or ten-minute walk, but it's uphill, and we were happy to take it slowly! My heart was racing (it raced all day), and the slightest exertion made me breathe faster.

We arrived to an excellent view of the valley leading toward Everest, with tantalizing glimpses of distant peaks that just might have been the main attraction. That lasted about 15 seconds. Then the clouds closed in, completely encasing Sagarmatha (Chomolungma/Everest), then Lhotse, then Nuptse. The closer Ama Dablam hung around for a minute or two before it, too, disappeared. 

![All the mountains badal bitra cha! (No clue how to spell that--but it means "inside the clouds.")](images/Namche_clouds_close_in_IMG_5463.jpg)

![The viewpoint does, however, have a lovely view of the Dudh Khosi valley downstream of Namche, the terrain we'd walked up the previous day. The Hillary Bridge is just below Namche.](images/Namche_lammergeier_IMG_5476.MOV)

![Lammergeiers soared through the valley below us.](images/Namche_lammergeiers_IMG_5481.jpg)

We just seen lammergeiers soaring around Samaria Gorge in western Crete, along with their bone-yard ossuaries. [Lammergeiers](https://www.audubon.org/magazine/lammergeier) are unique among birds in eating the bones of dead creatures--not the rotting flesh, the actual bones themselves. They drop big bones from great heights into particular areas. The bones get smashed small enough for the birds to swallow them, and their super-strong stomach acid does the rest. They do soar incredibly majestically.

![Toilets for three genders.](images/Namche_toilets_IMG_5486.jpg)

After a quick visit to the Sherpa museum (very small--hardly a tourist attraction, but good for a few minutes), Bala led us along one of the high paths that encircles the bowl in which Namche is situated. We passed an old man walking the circuit with his prayer beads. Bala said he was over 80, and did this walk every day for an hour.

![The colorful rooftops look so bright and happy in the sunshine!](images/Namche_view_from_above_IMG_5502.jpg)

![This is an exceptionally large load, even for a Nepali porter, but then pine needles don't weigh as much as plywood or rebar.](images/Namche_porter_IMG_5507.jpg)

![This is looking back from the path above the monastery, which is situated to the northwest of town.](images/Namche_looking_NW_IMG_5508.jpg)

The monastery is situated at the far side of town. Bala had arranged for the lama to do a special chant to wish us good fortune on our trek; the lama had already done his usual morning chanting, so this was extra work for him. The lama greeted us with little candies. After he was done chanting, he gave us silk scarves (these are ubiquitous in Nepal) and red strings to wear around our necks. We wore these strings throughout the rest of the trek.

![We had our own private service!](images/Namche_chant_IMG_5527.jpg)

![I had expected monks to be serious, but all the lamas I met were actually jolly fellows. They all have puffer jackets in lama-maroon.](images/Namche_lama_IMG_5533.jpg)

After church, we walked into town to get coffee at [Sherpa Barista and Bakery](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1203014-d10269471-Reviews-Sherpa_Barista_Bakery_food_Coffee_Shop-Namche_Bazaar_Khumbu_Sagarmatha_Zone_Eas.html), one of the well-known coffee shops in Namche. The walls are covered with photos of famous climbers and guides. The Khumbu region is famous for its apple pie so Chris and I shared a slice, which tbh was doughy and overly sweet. (Chris' mother, now, she could make an excellent pie!)

Bala took us to a charity shop to buy a couple of presents for family. He assured us that this place sold the genuine article, YakYakYak hats made of real yak wool, all crafted by widows of Sherpas who died in climbing accidents. Most of the stuff in Namche is apparently junk made in China and transported up from Kathmandu.

On the way back to the lodge, Bala greeted a little boy he knew. This child lived in Phortse, several hours walk away. His father had died in a climbing accident, and Bala had taken on the financial responsibility of getting him through high school. The boy spent the week in a hostel in town along with other kids who lived to far to commute and walked home on weekends, sometimes by himself.

![Kids of all ages live here. It seems like a nice, friendly place.](images/Namche_hostel_IMG_5548.jpg)

The electricity was still working in our bathroom, so we plugged in all our devices there. We assumed there was some backup generator providing juice to a few areas.

Chris and I were the only ones eating lunch at the Mountain Lodge today. Though we tried to keep it light, the servers brought us a dessert that we hadn't ordered, banana bread pudding. I ate one bite, but too much sugar was making my heart race, and I REALLY didn't want to come away from this multi-day mountain hike fatter than I started!

After a nap, the two of us walked into town by ourselves to buy decongestents and look around the town. My verdict was that Namche Bazaar itself presented some of the toughest terrain of the whole hike. It was all big, stone steps, many of them uneven, and enough climbing to make a visit to town a hiking stage in its own right.

![The cows don't struggle with the stairs.](images/Namche_cow_stairs_IMG_5540.jpg)

![I still regret that I didn't buy a YakBucks mug.](images/Namche_yakbuks_IMG_5544.jpg)

The power was still out, and the stores were dark. None of the credit card readers worked. Chris paid cash for a Sherpa brand t-shirt, which basically wiped out our Nepali funds. And we couldn't get more because the ATMs didn't work.... The only thing that saved us over the next week was that we didn't really need to pay for much, and everyone was happy to take American dollars.

NB: We showed up in Nepal with tips for guide and porter already allocated in their own envelopes, which we did NOT pillage at any point. This was a very smart plan, because it meant that we could tip the guys at the end no matter what.

Back at the lodge, we took our afternoon showers, optimistically imagining that the solar panels had had all day to soak up heat for the water. It was not to be. The water wasn't exactly ice cold, but hot it was not, nor even tepid. I didn't wash my hair.

The electricity in the bathroom was gone. It turned out that the "generator" servicing that outlet was solar-powered. Just like the shower. 

Dinner that night was Nepali hot pot. We got in bed right afterward and were asleep around 8:15. It was a dark and silent night without power.

### May 1: Everest View Hotel, Khunde, Khunjung

I woke up several times in the night gasping for breath.

Note to self: next time, actually pack the Afrin I'd meant to pack right before we left. Whatever decongestents we'd bought the previous day had no impact on nasal congestion, which turns out to be a problem in thin air. 

We were both awake shortly after five, and the sun was out! Seizing our window, we threw on clothes and down jackets and raced out the lodge (well, walked very slowly and deliberately) up to the Everest View Point.

![Only to see the clouds roll in.](images/Namche_early_clouds_IMG_5561.jpg)

Today's excursion was the popular acclimatization hike up to Everest View Hotel, followed by a tour of the Sherpa villages Khunde and Khunjung.

The trail up to the hotel is steep. It takes a couple of hours to get there at a very slow pace.

![I worried that this trail would scare me, but we couldn't see anything so I was fine.](images/EverestView_trail_IMG_5576.jpg)

![Bala says people used this birch bark as paper.](images/Paper_birch_IMG_5579.jpg)

The Everest View Hotel was built by a Japanese businessman to provide accommodations for wealthy Japanese (and other) clients who wanted a place to stay near Everest that they could reach by helicopter from Kathmandu. The rooms are said to be uncomfortably chilly.

![Whether the view is stupendous we really cannot say.](images/EverestViewHotel_IMG_5588.jpg)

![Snow started to fall as we left the hotel and headed to Khunde.](images/Khunde_trail_IMG_5605.jpg)

![Bala took us to visit the school founded by Sir Edmund Hillary.](images/Khunde_school_IMG_5611.MOV)

![We saw pictures drawn by some of the kids.](images/Khunde_school_pictures_IMG_5613.jpg)

![We also visited the famous monastery, home of the yeti skull. Bala says this one isn't genuine, but the one in Pangboche is.](images/Khunde_monastery_IMG_5617.jpg)

We had lunch in a guesthouse that was full of a group of Brits on their way to the Gokyo Lake area. Everyone was damp and chilly. Bala ordered us garlic ramen; garlic soup is said to be the best cure for altitude troubles.

![A typical Sherpa guesthouse.](images/Khunde_guesthouse_IMG_5607.jpg)

![The rooms here are much more basic than those in the Mountain Lodges.](images/Khunde_guesthouse_bed_IMG_5618.jpg)

This guesthouse has one toilet, a squatty potty on the ground floor shared by everyone sleeping and eating in the place. The light was out, making it even more of an adventure; phone flashlights provide lots of light, but you don't want to drop them in that setting.

![After lunch, we headed across the high plateau to Khunjung.](images/Khunjung_trail_IMG_5624.jpg) 

![Bala says that the women of Khunjung are highly sought after as they are widely acknowledged to be the most beautiful in the region. Every guy wants a Khunjung girl.](images/Khunjung_IMG_5633.jpg)

![We looked at the little health clinic. People join forces to transport anyone who needs care and can't walk up or down mountains to reach it. Serious cases go out on helicopters.](images/Khunjung_clinic_IMG_5627.jpg)

Bala's wife and many other residents of Namche work in these towns. The kids go to high school up there. It's completely normal for people to walk an hour or two each way as their daily commute.

![We walked past an old Russian airstrip. I imagine it would be hard to land in this fog....](images/Khunjung_airstrip_IMG_5647.jpg)

![I can't imagine where these kids manage to ride their bikes!](images/Khunjung_bikes_IMG_5651.jpg)

![Descending to Namche, we walked out of the clouds into a sunny afternoon.](images/Namche_return_IMG_5659.jpg) 

There was zero possibility that the water had heated that day, so we didn't bother with a shower at all. We were heading up the valley the next day, and Bala assured us that Deboche was on a different power line. 

I tried out my dry shampoo, but accidentally spilled it all over Chris' duffel. It looked like a scene from Annie Hall.

There was some consternation about our laundry, which we'd dropped off at the hotel two days earlier. The story, assembled from several staffers, was that our clothes were clean but still wet. True enough, the things I'd hand washed in our room took days to dry. But the staff assured us everything would be ready by our departure the next morning.

We had chili con carne again that night. It appears that the lodge alternates two dinner menus, which is generally enough because guests typically stay only two nights. Bala chose to dine at home that night, a rare opportunity to spend time with his wife.

The staff gave us hot water bottles that evening, which made the beds plenty warm. We fell asleep by 8:15, and each of us reported waking up only once in the night.


## Day 5: Namche to Deboche. 

We did the [Everest Lodge-to-Lodge hike](https://www.wildernesstravel.com/trip/nepal-everest-lodge-hiking-tour/) in the spring of 2025. (Well, technically, we were on the [Everest Private Journey](https://www.wildernesstravel.com/trip/everest-private-journey/), but the itinerary is basically the same) [Wilderness Travel](https://www.wildernesstravel.com) did a great job of organizing it!

A good time was had by all!

### May 2: Namche Bazaar--Deboche

![A view of the future: we could see the place we ate lunch in the foreground, the town of Phortse on the shelf beyond the valley, and Tengboche situated on top of the ridge to the right. Deboche and Pangboche are beyond it to the right.](images/Deboche_towns_ahead_IMG_5705.jpg)

It was time to move on up the trail!

Up before dawn, we packed our duffels, minus our clean laundry. We were prepared to make do if we had to. It's surprising how few clothes one really needs.

Breakfast was at 6:30. The kitchen was still dark, the chefs working by lamplight. After breakfast, a staffer handed us our laundry, neatly folded and stacked in a basket. I have no idea how they got it all dry, but we were now good to go.

![The porters were outside in the courtyard assembling their loads for the day.](images/Namche_porters_loading_IMG_5662.MOV)

![Mila Dai always looked so happy to be on the trail.](images/Namche_Mila_IMG_5672.jpg)

Today's walk started out "Nepali flat," gently undulating along the hillside above Namche. These trails are very wide because they're effectively highways. 

![Lots of people can walk abreast.](images/Deboche_wide_trail_IMG_5700.jpg)

![In Nepal, this is what they mean when they say a trail is "flat."](images/Deboche_trail_IMG_5743.jpg)

![The famous stupa that appears in everyone's blog.](images/Namche_stupa_IMG_5693.jpg)

We stopped for tea in [Kyangjunma](https://www.natureloverstrek.com/blog/all-you-need-to-know-about-kyangjuma--interesting-things-about-kyangjuma-village.htm) at the Ama Dablam Lodge & Restaurant, owned by Bala's friend Tashi. 

![The Ama Dablam Lodge.](images/Deboche_tashis_place_IMG_5729.jpg)

![Nepali food uses lots of garlic!](images/Deboche_peeling_garlic_IMG_5734.jpg)

![We encountered our first yaks!](images/Deboche_yaks_IMG_5749.MOV)

We had lunch in Phunki Thanga at the Zambala Lodge & Restaurant, which sits on the riverbank right next to the suspension bridge that leads to the start of the climb to Deboche. When he guides, Bala has to navigate the difficult politics of choosing restaurants to patronize. As we'd walked past one place earlier, the proprietor beseeched him to bring us there for lunch, but he said he'd already promised our custom to this place.

![Lunch. They don't do low-carb here, not ever!](images/Deboche_lunch_IMG_5761.jpg)

![The start of the trail after lunch.](images/Deboche_lunch_view_IMG_5758.jpg)

After lunch, we crossed the river and began the climb up to Tengboche. We climbed. And climbed. Slow and steady. We took a candy break after an hour of climbing, and then climbed some more. The clouds rolled in.

It was completely cloudy and late afternoon by the time we reached the crest where Tengboche is situated. 

![The big attraction in Tengboche is the massive monastery, but we didn't bother to visit this one.](images/Tengboche_monastery_IMG_5768.jpg)

![A new luxury hotel is going up in Tengboche.](images/Tengboche_new_construction_IMG_5771.jpg)

Most tourists stay in Tengboche, but we proceeded about half an hour further down the trail to Deboche, where Wilderness Travel had booked us into [Rivendell Lodge](https://www.khumburivendell.com). (A new [Mountain Lodge has just opened in Deboche](https://mountainlodgesofnepal.com/lodges/deboche-lodge/), and future trips might use it. We had no complaints about Rivendell, though.)

![Rivendell Lodge, owned by a local Sherpa couple.](images/Deboche_Rivendell_IMG_5774.jpg)

Rivendell is a pretty big lodge that's more of a "trekkers' lodge" than the Mountain Lodges. The rooms were more basic, and there were a lot more guests hanging out in the heated dining room. But Rivendell had a feature we'd been missing in our more luxurious accommodations in Namche: electricity! 

The lights in our room turned on! The outlets could charge our phones! We could even take showers that were approaching hot!

It feels VERY good to shower after not washing hair for three days. It was especially nice to wash out the "dry shampoo" I'd applied in a fit of optimism two days earlier. I know some people swear by the stuff, but to me it felt like applying powder to oil to create an unfortunate slurry that did nothing to make my hair cleaner. Fortunately, everyone on the trail wears buffs and hats. Probably to cover their awful hair.

Dinner was more basic than in the mountain lodges. We ordered off the menu instead of having a multi-course meal pre-set. Bala ordered dahl bhat, lentils with rice. He ate with his hands, Nepali style.

![I had momos, a Nepali standby. These are made correctly, unlike the ones I made when our son's mother-in-law tried to teach me how to shape them. That crescent shape is surprisingly difficult to form!](images/Deboche_momos_IMG_5776.jpg)

Bala said Mila Dai, our porter, was staying with friends in a house in town. Porters don't stay in the same hotels as guests. It sounds like the make do with whatever hospitality is available, and everyone helps everyone out. 

After dinner, Bala checked our oxygen saturation. Chris was at 90% and I was at 87%. This apparently was good. Bala pronounced us good to go and out of danger of any altitude complications.

Which didn't mean we weren't still feeling the thin air. I'd stopped waking up gasping for breath, but my heart was still maintaining a steady clip at all hours and I felt like I was breathing faster than usual. Maybe that's just what happens.

## Day 6: Deboche to Pangboche. 

We did the [Everest Lodge-to-Lodge hike](https://www.wildernesstravel.com/trip/nepal-everest-lodge-hiking-tour/) in the spring of 2025. (Well, technically, we were on the [Everest Private Journey](https://www.wildernesstravel.com/trip/everest-private-journey/), but the itinerary is basically the same) [Wilderness Travel](https://www.wildernesstravel.com) did a great job of organizing it!

A good time was had by all!



### May 3: Deboche--Pangboche

![Today was all about Ama Dablam!](images/Pangboche_header_AmaDablam_IMG_5882.jpg)

Today was a short walk, so Bala told us to report to breakfast at 8:30. We spent a leisurely morning drinking tea and reading before eating our masala omelettes.

![We paid for a wifi card so we could use the Internet at Rivendell Lodge. Our phones had pretty good data, though, so it wasn't entirely necessary.](images/Deboche_wifi_card_IMG_5775.jpg)

The standard [Everest Lodge-to-Lodge itinerary](https://www.wildernesstravel.com/trip/nepal-everest-lodge-hiking-tour/) puts guests in Pangboche for one night, after which they head on to Phortse. Pangboche is the jumping-off point for the hike to Ama Dablam base camp, so tour operators offer this as an optional addition to the day's hike. But. It's a long way! 

Doing Ama Dablam that day means combining the walk from Deboche to Pangboche (up to two hours, if you take it slow) with the hike to and from Ama Dablam base camp (5-7 hours with tons of climbing--"base camp" does not mean "base of mountain"). Which is a seriously long day of hiking. Bala starts his groups at 4 a.m., and they arrive in Pangboche around dinnertime.

Or they just walk to Pangboche and miss Ama Dablam. Which might be a pity if you actually wanted to do Ama Dablam and simply didn't have the time or energy.

![Upper Pangboche.](images/Pangboche_IMG_6012.jpg)

We wanted to do Ama Dablam but we didn't want to have to do a forced march followed by another day of hard walking to Phortse. And we didn't want to have to skip Ama Dablam base camp due to fatigue. I asked Wilderness Travel to book us two nights in Pangboche to give us time to both enjoy the scenery (well worth enjoying!) and do our mountain trek. This was a good plan.

It was another sunny morning, which is clearly not a given in these parts.

![We could see Everest from the yard!](images/Pangboche_Deboche_Everest_IMG_5794.jpg)

The walk from Deboche to Pangboche is another "Nepali flat" trail, though it trends uphill. We had astounding views of Ama Dablam the whole way. 

![Ama Dablam means "mother's necklace."](images/AmaDablam_IMG_5863.jpg)

![Looking back at Tengboche on its ridge.](images/Pangboche_Tengboche_IMG_5860.jpg)

![On a clear morning, there are great views of the Everest etc. ridge.](images/Pangboche_mountains_IMG_5896.jpg)

![We ran into Mila Dai, who looked happy as always to be in the mountains.](images/Pangboche_Mila_IMG_5888.jpg)

We reached the Everest Summit Lodge in Pangboche by 11. This was great; we had time to chill in the room and I managed a Clinical Somatics practice before lunch. (I highly recommend Clinical Somatics for anyone with back pain or other musculoskeletal issues, including bad posture. It takes a completely different approach to releasing muscle tension, and I credit it with my being entirely pain-free on this trek despite an annoying snapping hip that made walking difficult just four months earlier.)

![Entering Everest Summit Lodge.](images/Pangboche_ESL_IMG_5918.jpg)

![A smart way to heat water without using gas.](images/Pangboche_water_heater_IMG_5902.jpg)

![Planting potatoes.](images/Pangboche_potatoes_IMG_6051.jpg)

After an early lunch, Bala took us up the hill above Pangboche on the trail that leads to Everest Base Camp. This walk was beautiful and well worth lingering over. Though I had no wish to stay in bare-bones lodges, the trail upriver called to me; I wished we could see at least a little further up the valley. Maybe next year....

![Chris and Bala head up out of town.](images/Pangboche_afternoon_walk_IMG_5926.MOV)

![Looking up the Dudh Khosi valley toward Everest Base Camp.](images/Pangboche_trail_to_EBC_IMG_5954.jpg)

![Carrying stuff back from the EBC area.](images/Pangboche_jokyos_IMG_5937.MOV)

![Prayer wheels in the wind.](images/Pangboche_hilltop_monastery_IMG_5995.MOV)

Pangboche's main claim to fame is a [monastery](https://www.outsideonline.com/outdoor-adventure/everest/pangboche-monastery-mount-everest) that houses a [yeti hand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pangboche_Hand). The story goes that the yeti was devoted to a lama and helped him build the monastery. After the yeti died, he donated both his hand and his scalp (or bit of skull?) to the lama, who installed them in the monastery as holy relics. We couldn't photograph the hand, but it is very large and resembles the hand of an orang utan. Bala assured us that, while the yeti skull in Khunde is most likely antelope and not yeti at all, the relics here are genuine yeti parts.

![The famous monastery, with a sign to EBC.](images/Pangboche_monastery_IMG_6048.jpg)

![USAID gave Pangboche $50K or so to rebuild the monastery after it was severely damaged in the 2015 earthquake. The Trump administration did **not** rescind or limit this gift (as everyone there told us… they are big Trump fans in the mountains.)](images/Pangboche_USAID_IMG_6045.jpg)

![We saw yaks cavorting about the hillside.](images/Pangboche_yaks_IMG_5961.MOV)

![I visited the toilets in a hillside schoolyard, which involved climbing through a fence and down a stone wall and back up again.](images/Pangboche_school_IMG_5990.jpg)

The showers at Everest Summit Lodge are gas-powered, which meant that the water was truly hot. What a delicious feeling! 

![The kitchen at Everest Summit Lodge uses gas to cook.](images/Pangboche_kitchen_IMG_6061.jpg)

Chris spent the early evening sitting outside the lodge watching the sun set on the three biggies, Nuptse, Everest, and Lhotse. 

![There was a great view of Ama Dablam from the dining room.](images/Pangboche_AmaDablam_from_dining_room_IMG_6066.jpg)

The stoves in the dining room, on the other hand, were powered by yak dung. There's no wood available higher in the mountains, but there's yak dung aplenty. Mila dai, our porter, reportedly supplemented his income on his days off by collecting yak dung in the hills. (He spent the next day, when we didn't move, carting a load all the way to Namche and another one back to Pangboche.)

![Yak dung doesn't stink at all. It's just grass.](images/Pangboche_stove_IMG_6241.jpg)

The Everest Summit Lodge has two levels of accommodation, basic and "comfort." We saw other tourists who were clearly staying there, but they didn't appear in our dining room because they weren't on the comfort package. We had the place to ourselves.

![Chris reports that he "froze his butt off" on the side of the mountain capturing this time-lapse of Nupste (left), Everest (center), and Lhoste (right).](images/MMNT_LAPSE_20250503170413599.MOV)


## Day 7: Ama Dablam.

We did the [Everest Lodge-to-Lodge hike](https://www.wildernesstravel.com/trip/nepal-everest-lodge-hiking-tour/) in the spring of 2025. (Well, technically, we were on the [Everest Private Journey](https://www.wildernesstravel.com/trip/everest-private-journey/), but the itinerary is basically the same) [Wilderness Travel](https://www.wildernesstravel.com) did a great job of organizing it!

A good time was had by all!



### May 4: Ama Dablam Base Camp

![This is legit the Ama Dablam base camp, not that you can see Ama Dablam or much else.](images/Ama_header_IMG_6154.jpg)

Today we climbed up Ama Dablam! To base camp, not the summit, but still!

We started early. We descended to the river, crossed the little bridge over the Dudh Khosi, and then started climbing. We followed the trail that all climbers attempting to summit Ama Dablam take.

![We could see all the trails that crisscross the mountains, including the high trail we'd take to Phortse the next day.](images/Ama_trail_to_Phortse_IMG_6100.jpg)

The morning had started partly cloudy, and fairly quickly became completely cloudy. We reached a "viewpoint" at the moment the clouds closed over Nuptse and Lhotse; we never seen Everest at all.

![Lots of groups of hikers do this trail as an acclimatization hike for Everest Base Camp. This group is heading to a great view!](images/Ama_hikers_heading_to_viewpoint_IMG_6106.jpg)

![And the clouds close in!](images/Ama_clouds_close_in_IMG_6118.jpg)

![We walked through the sand of an ancient beach.](images/Ama_beach_IMG_6125.jpg)

As we climbed further, the cloud cover turned into cloud immersion. We walked through a gray mist in a landscape of big rocks.

![Nothing to see here....](images/Ama_fog_IMG_6143.jpg)

By the time we reached base camp, it had started to snow. We couldn't even tell where the main peak of Ama Dablam was. I had no idea which way people walked to head toward the summit.

![Lots of snow!](images/Ama_snow_IMG_6195.jpg)

![Southern girls don't expect snow on May 4!](images/Ama_snow_IMG_6198.jpg)

![But we made it!](images/Ama_kiss_IMG_6153.jpg)

![Base camp is in a wide flat bowl.](images/Ama_basecamp_IMG_6166.jpg)

Bala of course knew all the porters and guides in the camp. They invited us into the kitchen tent for tea. 

![Bala knows everyone in the Khumbu!](images/Ama_tea_IMG_6178.jpg)

From camp, we walked the short path to Mingbo La pass, where we ate our packed lunch in a teahouse.

![Mingbo-La.](images/Ama_Mingbo_IMG_6204.jpg)

![Primula](images/Ama_Primula_IMG_6209.jpg)

It was still snowing as we headed back down the path toward Pangboche. I broke out the Lexi cane I'd been carrying just in case; I really don't get what trekking poles were for, but this little cane provided some extra physical data for walking on particularly steep or slippery terrain, especially for stepping down large steps. (Was it essential? Who knows, but I doubt it, since I almost never use a stick of any kind and generally do fine.)

One thing I did regret was that I hadn't brought along my rain pants. This is the one day they would've been useful. Well, the also would've been nice to have the day we walked up to Khunde and Khunjung. I ended up never breaking them out at all this whole trip, and Mila Dai carried them everywhere. I made it up to him by giving them to him in Lukla at the end of the trip--he was delighted with them.

![The path down was muddy and steep. Also, much of it was covered with snow.](images/Ama_way_down_IMG_6222.jpg)

![The trail above the river is rocky.](images/Ama_rocky_trail_IMG_6231.jpg)

I entered our room looking forward to another hot shower, but alas! It was not hot! Apparently the maids had messed with one of the knobs we'd been strictly instructed not to turn, resulting in a heavier flow of water and thus less heat per water molecule. I had to take a nap with the electric blanket to get warm again. At least Chris got a hot shower after the owner fixed it.

The dining room was cold when we entered before dinner. Like, down jacket on top of fleece cold. The proprietor stoked the yak-dung stove, and the room gradually warmed up.

![Chris accidentally let a bunch of dung fall out of the stove. It's really dry, though.](images/Ama_dung_IMG_6240.jpg)

![Custom is to pour kerosene or lighter fluid or something onto the dung to help it ignite.](images/Ama_stove_IMG_6242.jpg)

![After seeing very little on the actual hike up Ama Dablam, Chris got this sunset timelapse from our inn.](images/MMNT_LAPSE_20250503182137480.MOV)

We had another early night. This evening, after the sun set on Ama Dablam, there was nothing to see, and we were tired. It was good to sleep!



## Day 8: Pangboche--Phortse

We did the [Everest Lodge-to-Lodge hike](https://www.wildernesstravel.com/trip/nepal-everest-lodge-hiking-tour/) in the spring of 2025. (Well, technically, we were on the [Everest Private Journey](https://www.wildernesstravel.com/trip/everest-private-journey/), but the itinerary is basically the same) [Wilderness Travel](https://www.wildernesstravel.com) did a great job of organizing it!

A good time was had by all!


### May 5: Hiking to Phortse

![A sign pointing the way to Phortse, spelled etymologically.](images/Phortse_sign_IMG_6251.jpg)

This was the day that I fretted the most about in my pre-departure obsessive reading on all things Everest. Why? Blogs like [this one](https://www.alessprocessedlife.com/2011/12/nepal-trek-day-nine-phortse-pangboche.html), that describe four hours of walking along a steep drop-off. Or [this one](https://teessidewandering.wordpress.com/2017/04/06/day-12/), with its comment, "The trail was a little hairy in places, particularly towards the end...." 

Bala assured me that this trail was in fact one of the most beautiful on the route, and that scary tales were surely describing the old, lower trail, one that locals still use because it's shorter but that is now disparaged among trekkers. He promised that the new trail was wide, well-maintained, and never exposed.

I didn't entirely trust him.

My fear was that this would be even scarier than the day Chris and I walked from Grüben to St. Niklaus on the Haute Route in Switzerland, where we encountered a washed-out gulley that STILL gives me nightmares. I wondered what would happen if I reached a bit of trail I simply couldn't bring myself to traverse. That day in Switzerland, I briefly considered the possibility of walking back to Grüben, even though we'd be walking six hours by that point--and had already crossed the pass of the day. I supposed I could always return to Pangboche and we'd figure it out from there.

![Chris did that whole trail in Switzerland with his right arm in a sling. This is him stopping to take his meds right before the scary bit, which you can see behind him. That Swiss trail was WAAAY scarier than anything we saw in Nepal!](images/Switzerland_Chris_IMG_9057.jpg)

This day was a good lesson in why it's dumb to fret about stuff before you actually see it. This trail was one of the most beautiful, show-stopping experiences of the entire trip, and it never got scary.

We were up early as always. We were both getting tired, our "leisurely" adjustments to the itinerary notwithstanding. It's just hard to walk in the mountains every day, to be cold all the time, and to never have any real downtime. We still struggled to catch our breath when we went above 14,000 feet. 

![Leaving Pangboche](images/Phortse_leaving_pangboche_IMG_6246.jpg)

The trail between Pangboche and Phortse contours around the south-facing mountainsides north of the Dudh Khosi. It parallels the trail we'd walked two days earlier from Tengboche to Pangboche, but higher up and on the other side of the river.

![Looking back toward Pangboche and Ama Dablam, coyly peeking out from the clouds this morning.](images/Phortse_back_to_Ama_IMG_6325.jpg)

![We had a good perspective on Tenboche on top of the ridge and Deboche below; it was a great view of the way we'd come two days earlier.](images/Phortse_TengbocheDeboche_IMG_6356.jpg)

It was definitely the trail that appeared in the [Stairway to Heaven blog](https://teessidewandering.wordpress.com/2017/04/06/day-12/) that I linked to above, so ymmv. Maybe I'm just less scared when Bala is around, or have less oxygen to waste on pointless emotions. But a big part of it is that this trail is simply wider. That makes such a big difference in comfort.

![This is the same shot that was in that blog! Plus a cave.](images/Phortse_cave_trail_IMG_6294.jpg)

![The trail definitely had some steep spots.](images/Phortse_porter_IMG_6362.MOV)

Just before we reached Phortse, Bala grabbed me and said that the next section would indeed be a little scary, but it was short and I could manage it. This, you see, is good guide-craft. He got me through 95% of the walk believing that I wasn't going to freak about anything full well KNOWING that there would be some stuff that would be hair-raising. We were so close at that point, I figured I'd manage.

And... I didn't have to! We rounded the bend to discover that the trail had been completely redone and modernized with concrete and metal railings. It looked like a western tourist establishment, and there was absolutely nothing to fear there. 

![This trail was NOT scary!](images/Phortse_good_trail_IMG_6409.jpg)

![And there's Phortse!](images/Phortse_IMG_6431.jpg)

Phortse (pronounced FOR-che) is a Sherpa settlement on a sunny shelf, the type of terrain that lends itself to terraced potato fields. [Phortse](https://www.natureloverstrek.com/blog/phortse-trail-as-an-alternative-to-the-tengboche-trail.htm) is often held up as an off-the-beaten-track town, or a good alternate route to and from EBC that skips the crowds going the usual way through Tengboche. While the trail we'd just walked was far from deserted--we saw tourists and porters moving in both directions--it wasn't nearly as busy as the trail between Tengboche and Pangboche. 

![Entering Phortse.](images/Phortse_entering_town_IMG_6445.jpg)

![Yak dung drying prior to being burned in stoves.](images/Phortse_dung_IMG_6442.jpg)

We were the only guests in the Sherpa lodge where we stayed that night. This was another no-shower place (we might have been able to pay for them? I never figured that out and didn't care because I'd taken advantage of our gas-powered shower that morning in Pangboche.) The toilets were down the hall; Bala put a Wilderness Travel sticker on the door of the "western" toilet so we wouldn't accidentally be dismayed by the Asian one. There were no outlets in our room, but we could charge our devices in the dining hall.

![Lunch: Sherpa stew, french fries, and a veggie pie. Sherpa lodges don't do low-carb.](images/Phortse_lunch_IMG_6451.jpg)

After lunch, we lay down for a couple of hours. I found myself wanting to squeeze rest into as many moments as possible.

![Our room, with a lovely view over town.](images/Phortse_room_IMG_6456.jpg)

That afternoon, Bala took us on a little tour of the town to see the Khumbu Climbing Center, where we shook hands with Conrad Ankar himself, and then out to the forest to look for birds. On the way back to our lodge, we stopped at his friend's house for tea. 

![The Khumbu Climbing Center provides climbing training to locals so they can get better-paying technical jobs on expeditions.](images/Phortse_KCC_IMG_6472.jpg)

![There are yaks in Phortse.](images/Phortse_yak_IMG_6479.jpg)

![There are also potato fields.](images/Phortse_potato_fields_IMG_6513.jpg)

![We spotted a danphe, the Nepali national bird; it looks a little like a peacock.](images/Phortse_danphe_IMG_6496.jpg)

Mila Dai joined us at dinner that evening. The Sherpa girls made us dahl baht, the traditional Nepali dish of lentils and rice. That was the only day on the trek that we had this classic dish, though I read that it's typical daily fare for most trekkers. 

Someone from the Khumbu Climbing Center called to invite us to come watch a documentary that evening, which was very sweet, but we were so very tired, the KCC seemed so very far away (and the paths through town so very dark and muddy), and the movie would start at 9. That was a good half hour after our bedtime.

One thing Chris had looked forward to on this trip was the chance to do dark night photography, and a remote Sherpa village seemed like it would be the ideal spot. It was not to be. Phortse, like every other place we stayed, had ample night-time light in the form of street lights, and we were never awake much after dark anyway.

## Day 9. Phortse to Namche Bazaar. 

![Chris and Bala check out an old house in Phortse. Livestock can stay in the bottom to help heat the top.](images/Phortse_house_IMG_6524.jpg)

Both of us woke up with cracked, chapped lips. Chris seemed to have caught a cold.

The dining room was freezing. Our hosts didn't bother to light the stove that morning, so we huddled in our down jackets and warmed our hands on cups of tea. 

![Morning in Phortse](images/Phortse_morning_IMG_6523.jpg)

![We stopped for coffee at the Khumbu Climbing Center.](images/Phortse_KCC_IMG_6527.jpg)

![This painting at the KCC is a great depiction of the Khumbu trails and towns!](images/Phortse_painting_IMG_6528.jpg)

The trail back to Namche took us through town back to the forest we'd briefly explored yesterday and then down to the river. 

![Looking upriver toward the Gokyo lakes area, where we should definitely go next year!](images/Phortse_upriver_IMG_6539.jpg)

We crossed on a low bridge, passed the town of Phortse Tenga, and then climbed back up level with Phortse and higher still. 

![It is a stiff climb!](images/Phortse_Tenga_up_IMG_6569.jpg)

![We had a great view of Phortse, situated on its high shelf.](images/Phortse_Tenga_backtoPhortse_IMG_6599.jpg)

When we reached the top, we stopped for tea at the View Point Guest House in Mong La. 

![We had a great view of more clouds.](images/MongLa_IMG_6616.jpg)

The trail from Mong La back to Kyangjuma is charming, open and wild and with a great view down to the many helicopters following the river up the valley. This trail is higher and narrower than the main trail to Tengboche but gives a much more "mountain" vibe. 

![This was really a lovely trail to walk!](images/MongLa_trail_IMG_6622.jpg)

![Better stand aside!](images/MongLa_jokyos_IMG_6640.MOV)

![Yaks graze on the hillsides. Well, naks, not yaks. The yaks are all busy hauling stuff.](images/MongLa_nak_IMG_6646.jpg)

![After a series of staircases down, we met up with our old trail.](images/MongLa_stairs_IMG_6662.jpg)

We had lunch at Tashi's place in Kyangjungma, the Ama Dablam Lodge & Restaurant. Mila Dai, who was of course way ahead of us, had stopped in to order yak burgers for us.

![Yak burger!](images/MongLa_yak_burger_IMG_6678.jpg)

The walk from there to Namche seemed easy. It was more down than up, and all that acclimatization at higher altitudes must have been making a difference because the walking stopped being difficult. Bala was in a bit of a rush too, eager to get home and get a bit of a break. We did that last stretch in under 90 minutes.

![We passed the same stupa as before, this time socked in with clouds.](images/Namche_stupa2_IMG_6702.jpg)

The Mountain Lodge put us in our former room's twin on the opposite side of the hotel. It felt like coming home, except this time the electricity worked!

This room had a view of the entrance to the school. It was charming to see the kids playing at recess; they all seemed happy to be there, and happy to head home when school let out. After the kids left, several local cows wander into the gate to hang out in the school yard.

We were on our own for dinner. Bala ate with Mila at his house. Without his constant supervision, we felt free to drink TWO rum punches (they are not very strong....) and to display loss of appetite if we so desired!

## Day 10: Namche to Monjo. 

![Our last view of Namche, nestled in the clouds this morning.](images/Namche_cloudy_last_view_IMG_6713.jpg)

This morning we had a slightly late breakfast and departure because Bala needed to hang new prayer flags on his mother's house, or something along those lines. It didn't matter because today's walk was short and downhill.

We were only going to Monjo, the place we'd stopped for lunch on our second day hiking. Some treks walk all the way from Namche to Lukla on the last day, and I'm pretty sure that would've been possible, but it would also have made for a pretty long hike. I suppose the travel agencies don't want to take chances on that crucial last day. And it was nice to explore Monjo.

We left the lodge and walked down into town. The steps STILL seemed really large and uneven! 

![We finally got more money from a functioning ATM! Chris kindly took a picture of this tour group from the US.](images/Namche_tourists_IMG_6715.jpg)

Bala took us to a gift shop so I could by a mala, or set of prayer beads, for my brother. He wanted to make sure I got the genuine article made of real bodhichitta seeds and not Chinese schlock.

![I wore that mala for the rest of the trek to imbue it with good Khumbu karma.](images/Mala_IMG_6943.jpg)

The walk from Namche down to the Hillary Bridge was so much easier than the walk from the Hillary Bridge up to Namche it almost seemed like they were different trails. 

![Everything seemed easy now!](images/HillaryBridge_us_IMG_6733.jpg)

![we passed several porters carrying loads of construction supplies uphill. There's a lot of construction going on in Namche right now, and this is how supplies are brought in. Bala says some of these guys carry something like 200 pounds on their back.](images/HillaryBridge_porters_IMG_6748.MOV)

Because I'd complained about the state of the regular trail walking up to Namche (loose, dusty, steep, and not really a trail at all), Bala took us on the higher trail used by the donkey trains. This trail is wide and well-maintained. I noticed that large sections of it were muddy. This happens sometimes in South Carolina state parks, due to water seeping out of the hill, and I assumed that this was what was going on. But when I asked Bala what caused the periodic mud patches, he said, "All the donkeys in a group pee and poop at the same time."

Wait... this was pee?

That was when I asked Chris not to walk to close to me, lest we foul one another's steps and both end up slipping into pee-mud.

![This deer crossed our path around Jorsalle.](images/Jorsalle_deer_IMG_6780.mov)

![We walked back out of Sagarmatha National Park.](images/Park_leaving_IMG_6790.jpg)

We arrived at Monjo around lunchtime. 

![The monks had nearly finished painting the mantra stones that they'd been working on the last time we visited.](images/Monjo_mantra_stones_IMG_6797.jpg)

![The lodge there had put us in the nicest room, huge and bright!](images/Monjo_room_IMG_6802.jpg)

After lunch, Bala took us on a late-afternoon walk up above town. Unbelievably, we STILL gasped for breath while climbing! 

![We saw some of the most amazing birds. This is a forktail.](images/Monjo_forktail_IMG_6820.MOV)

![Looking down on Monjo.](images/Monjo_view_IMG_6853.jpg)

That evening, Bala cooked his special spicy pork appetizer for us to enjoy during happy hour.

He told us a long-promised story about Yetis. Apparently, long ago in the past (distant or perhaps not-so-distant), the yetis lived on the hillsides above the towns in the Pangboche region. They are high-altitude cold-adapted species like snow leopards or yaks. 

The yetis were fascinated with human societies. Every day, they would watch the humans going about their business, working in the fields, building fires, and herding animals. Then every night, the yetis would act out their own interpretation of what the humans had been doing.

The humans decided that they could exploit this behavior to eliminate the yetis. One day, they brought out barrels of alcohol and piles of weapons. They pretended to drink from the barrels and then to fight with the weapons.

That night, the yetis came down to the village and found the props still laid out. They proceeded to enact what they thought they had seen, but they actually drank the alcohol. This made them drunk, so that when they came to fight with the weapons, they really fought. They fought so hard that all of them died except for one male and one female. This pair retreated to the mountains, where they perhaps maintained some vestigial yeti population.

This story.... so much to unpack! It makes me think that some group of hominids that could be seen as yetis might well have existed and were genocided by humans, as might have happened with our Neanderthal cousins or with other groups of native human groups. 

![Dinner menu](images/Monjo_dinner_IMG_6804.jpg)

## Day 11: Monjo to Lukla. 


I awoke to texts from our kids reporting that they had arrived in Kathmandu and checked into the Ramada with no difficulty. This was good! We were starting to get anxious about returning to the city on time and plunging directly into wedding activities.

Our lips were still beyond chapped. They stayed dry, cracked, and bleeding for several days after we got back to Kathmandu.

Bala had us start out early this morning and kept up a brisk pace. He wanted to get into Lukla early so that he could visit the station master at the airport and move us to an earlier morning flight to Kathmandu the next day.

![Mila Dai was up and ready to go!](images/Monjo_Mila_IMG_6871.jpg)

![This was almost the only cat we saw the whole trek.](images/Lukla_cat_IMG_6889.jpg)

The trail was crowded for the first time this trip. Hordes of tour groups were heading uphill toward base camp, perhaps because the weather finally looked promising. Some of the Indian groups looked like they had 40 or 50 participants. This was the sort of crowding I'd half expected and had been pleasantly surprised to avoid. September and October are the real high season, though; the clear weather would be an attraction, but it would be hard to have to deal with constant crowding on the trails.

![The traffic had picked up!](images/Lukla_traffic_IMG_6913.MOV)

![We stopped for tea on a sunny terrace.](images/Lukla_tea_IMG_6910.jpg)

![We broke for lunch at the Mountain Lodge in Phakding, where we'd spent our first night.](images/Phakding_lodge_IMG_6940.jpg)

Bala wanted us to eat a quick, light lunch, and Chris and I were down with that, but evidently the Mountain Lodges don't do quick and light. We sat at the table for over an hour, first enjoying herbal tea and cookies and then having a spicy potato appetizer, fried chicken sandwiches, and dessert. So much for out anticipated weight loss on the trail!

Bala set a brisk pace for the last section of the trail. No more lingering or stopping to take a million pictures for us! We arrived at the Lukla Mountain Lodge in mid-afternoon, with plenty of time for Bala to complete his errand.

It was STILL hard to climb all those steps up to the Lukla Mountain Lodge!

The hotel manager promised us plenty of hot water for our showers. This was a false promise. The water wasn't even trying to be hot. The bathrooms also had that odd set-up where the shower isn't contained at all, which meant that the bathroom floors were entirely soaked. 

Ah well! We knew not to expect perfect luxury on this trek. At least we were clean.

We took a brief walk through town, mainly to visit the Lukla Gear shop (didn't see anything we wanted) and the airport. 

![Seems like it's always cloudy or raining in Lukla.](images/Lukla_house_IMG_6953.jpg)

![The runway is indeed very short and visibly slanted downhill.](images/Lukla_runway_IMG_6963.jpg) 

Bala insists that the Lukla airport's reputation as "the most dangerous airport in the world" is completely undeserved, and that it has a very good record of flights safely taking off and landing. 

![There's a gold statue of Tenzing Norgay and Edmund Hillary at the Lukla airport.](images/Lukla_airport_statue_IMG_6959.jpg)

Tonight was the only night we ate out at a town restaurant instead of in the Mountain Lodge's own dining room. Before dinner, we met Bala and Mila in the lobby for the grand gear giveaway. I gave the two of them nearly all my clothes and gear. Bala had already claimed my Ghost Whisperer for his wife and my Leki cane for his mother, and was happy to take my North Fake duffel from Thamel for his own gear. Mila accepted everything I offered, including dirty leggings and Uniqlo Heattech shirts with rips in the collars. He was especially delighted to receive my rain pants, which he'd carried to Pangboche and back and I'd never worn. Chris handed over most of his batteries to Bala. 

> Tip: Don't buy those "solar powered powerbanks" you see on Amazon. There is no universe in which they will charge fast enough to be useful. You can walk to electricity much faster than they can charge, even under the brightest sun. Unless you are going to the South Pole or something, they just add weight and expense. 

![Mila Dai was delighted to receive a purple Furman University t-shirt; he put it right on to wear to dinner.](images/Mila_Furman_IMG_6957.jpg)

This giveaway is customary, and it is one of the reasons why you see rural Nepalis who might make $1300 a year going around in North Face and Patagonia. I realized that part of our journey to the mountains was as importers; shipping to the Khumbu faces all the same difficulties that just plain traveling does, so visitors leaving gear and clothing behind kills two birds with one stone. 


Before we left the U.S., I'd asked Hunter at Wilderness Travel how much we should give in gratuities. She replied "Tipping is ultimately up to your discretion, but you can use a suggestion of around $10/trekking day for the porter and $15/day for the main guide. Either USD or rupees are fine to use for tipping. You’ll have the same guide and porter throughout, so you can tip at the last dinner at the end of the trek."

We followed these guidelines and had actually brought that cash in envelopes with us from the U.S. Chris had been adding to the amounts as we traveled--once we saw how much work it is to trek and carry in Nepal, we really appreciated the effort the guys were making!

We walked through town and behind the end of the runway to a restaurant, where we struggled to make conversation with Mila. He speaks no English and maybe not even much Nepali (he's a Rai, a Christian ethnic group), so Bala had to interpret absolutely everything. But it was interesting. Mila is in his late 50s. He lives two days walk downhill from Lukla. His oldest son is 30, and his youngest child (of four?) is in his early teens. The oldest son still hasn't finished high school, and allegedly claims that he won't marry until he hits this milestone. It can take the mountain kids years to finish grades because they are needed to work the farms and tend the livestock. Also, the schools can be long walks from their homes.

Chris handed over our tips at the end of dinner. He did this somewhat formally--in Nepal, it's polite to hand gifts to people with both hands, and they receive them the same way.

This was another early night for us. All we wanted that trip was to go to bed early and sleep as long as we could.

## Day 12: Lukla to Kathmandu. 

We were up at dawn as usual. It was odd to eat breakfast among other tourists. The Mountain Lodge was getting set up for a visit by VIPs, with tables out on the patio.

Bala and Mila were both happy that morning, which we hoped meant that they'd been pleased with their gratuities.

We walked out to the airport at 8 to catch our 9 a.m. flight. 

![A successful takeoff!](images/Lukla_takeoff_IMG_6972.mov)

The Lukla airport is alarmingly chaotic, with a polyglot crowd of tourists and locals all anxious to land seats on flights back to Kathmandu. Everyone is first supposed to go through a security check to enter the airport, though people seem to cut around it all the time. There are no signs or announcements of departures. It looks like lots of people just show up there hoping to fly out that day without existing reservations. We were very happy to have Bala to navigate the logistics for us. 

![It would be extremely intimidating to face this scrum alone!](images/Lukla_airport_chaos_IMG_6973.jpg)

The airport was running flights to Ramenchap first. Bala told us to settle in and wait; we were clearly not departing at 9! 

![Four planes would load at once, staggering takeoffs and landings.](images/Lukla_planes_IMG_6977.jpg)

We sat at a table in the "coffee shop" area and watched the same Twin Otters take off and land repeatedly. It took them about an hour to do a round trip, and at least two rounds of this happened before our flight was called to go through the actual security check, along with getting our names checked off on a handwritten list.

We then sat in the gate area for another half hour or so. When our flight seemed to be getting close, Bala had us walk up to the door to the tarmac and form the beginning of a line. He was keen on our landing seats on the right side of the plane, which look north toward the mountains we'd just walked through. (There are no assigned seats on these flights. It's every man for himself.)

We finally boarded our plane at 11:20. Everyone crowded in; they fit in as many seats as possible, and there's no storage for hand luggage. I just stuffed my backpack on the floor in front of my feet.

The takeoff went quickly--we'd watched a bunch of planes use this runway, and they all achieved liftoff well before the end of it. The pilots made this all look easy.

The beautiful views of the mountains didn't materialize; the clouds had rolled in again, so we mostly saw mist. But we could still see the mountains (foothills?) close to us, with their red rhododendrons and dirt roads winding up the steep sides.

We had to circle Kathmandu before landing. This is common; the Kathmandu airport has too much traffic. This is one reason most domestic flights take off and land from Ramenchap. We were very fortunate to have a direct flight to Kathmandu. Even with a delay of more than two hours, we got into town much earlier than we would have flying to Ramenchap and then driving to Kathmandu, which would've taken all afternoon.

Pankaj met us at the baggage claim. He'd already been at the airport at dawn to collect my sister, brother, and nephew, who'd all flown in for the upcoming wedding. He reported that everything had gone well and that he'd handed Madeleine the dress I'd bought for her two weeks earlier. 

We said goodbye to Bala, who was off to see his mother and daughters. Then we climbed into our taxi and headed off to the Ramada. We reached the hotel by 12:45, in time to meet the gang for lunch nearby.

And with that, our Everest Lodge-to-Lodge experience came to an end! It was time to do a hard pivot to a South Asian wedding!

## Aftermath: Big Kathmandu Wedding

We returned to Kathmandu for a big family wedding, uniting our American family with a large Nepali family. 

This is a story about our trek, not about our family and friends who did not necessarily agree to feature in a travel-blog. But we can say that it was an amazing experience: warm, generous, spiritual, meaningful, lively, fun, and often exhausting!

Suffice it to say, we now have a built-in excuse to return!

Thanks for reading, y'all!
