# Everest Lodge-to-Lodge, April 28--May 9, 2025

We did the [Everest Lodge-to-Lodge hike](https://www.wildernesstravel.com/trip/nepal-everest-lodge-hiking-tour/) in the spring of 2025. (Well, technically, we were on the [Everest Private Journey](https://www.wildernesstravel.com/trip/everest-private-journey/), but the itinerary is basically the same) [Wilderness Travel](https://www.wildernesstravel.com) did a great job of organizing it!

A good time was had by all!

# Peripatos and Khumbu--Proof of Proof of Concept

Part of [the point of the Peripatos project](https://eumaeus.substack.com/p/peripatos-2024-statement-of-purpose) was to get a sense of what travel and general human existence were like in ancient times, back when all land travel was done on foot - maybe an animal's feet, but still. We realized that much of the difference between then and now was the result of where wheels can go and where they can't.

When paths were narrow and rocky, walking was the only way to traverse them. The wheel, for all its advantages, couldn't go everywhere. 

The problem is that modern Greece isn't ancient. No matter where we went, we couldn't escape the wheel, usually attached to the internal combustion engine. Maybe that wasn't really a problem--we do enjoy modern comforts and conveniences--but it did keep us from experiencing a genuinely wheel-free society.

But! There are still a few places in the world where the wheel has yet to make an impact. In fact, there are places where the wheel will probably never take over because it simply can't. 

Meet the [Khumbu Valley](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/blog/khumbu-region).

## The Khumbu and the way to Everest

Nepal is an interesting place. It's a modern country--everyone has a cell phone and just-in-time ride-sharing is totally a thing in Kathmandu--but it's also got one of the lowest per-capita national incomes in the world. There are roads and cars aplenty, but many of those roads are rough, to put it mildly. The city of Kathmandu is full of cute new restaurants and glamorous clothing (all those kurti and saris!!!!) but you can't drink the water, and the power goes out all the time.

The Khumbu region, also known as the Everest region, is northeast of Kathmandu. As the crow flies, it's not far, but it might as well be across the ocean as far as most transportation is concerned. To be fair, you can walk there. The first Everest expeditions did just that, hiking all the way from Kathmandu with an army of porters.

But today, most people--tourists and locals--get to the Khumbu region by flying into Lukla. And once they're there, they walk.

This is because of the local geography. Remember how geography is destiny? The Khumbu region consists of the highest mountains and deepest river valleys in the world. It's simply not amenable to road-building. There are well-maintained trails aplenty, but they're full of steep and irregular steps, irregular rocks, sudden narrow bits, and other features that render bikes, carts, and ATVs out of the question.

## An entirely pedestrian culture

EVERYONE walks. 

Little kids walk to school, of course, but in the Khumbu they might walk six or seven hours to get there. Children in Pangboche or Phortse might go to school in Namche. They walk to Namche every Sunday, a six hour walk, holding hands with their siblings or friends if they have them--though some little ones walk alone. They stay in a hostel during the week and then walk back home for the weekend on Friday.

Adults walk to work, which might be two hours away. Up a mountain. They might or might not come back home every night.

Our guide Bala's two daughters go to school in Kathmandu. When they come home to Namche, they fly to Lukla and then walk a full day to get home. Bala's elderly mother has to do the same. 

There are donkeys, of course, and some people have horses. You generally don't see many people riding them, though. Some tourists end up riding horses due to injury or altitude sickness, but there don't seem to be any horse tours of the area. 



## Moving goods: beasts of burden

Without wheels, how do goods move around? How do shops stock their shelves, restaurants stock their pantries, builders stock supplies? 

Goods move on foot. Attached to backs. The backs might be attached to two or four legs.

Sure, some stuff comes in on planes and helicopters, and in 2025, drones started flying gear up to Everest. But the vast, vast majority of goods are transported the very old-fashioned way.

![Above Namche, yak-cow hybrids called jhopkyos do most of the carrying. Walkers are advised to watch out for their horns!]

Tourists have very mixed feelings about human porters. It's a hard job, to be sure. Bala told us that many porters won't carry water because that adds weight to their loads, and they want to maximize their paying loads. 

## Going back in time

Travel wasn't the only aspect of the Khumbu that resembled the past, distant and not-so-distant. There is ubiquitous electricity, but when it goes out, everyone is forced to rely on solid and present fuels. During the three-day Namche power outage, the lodges cooked with gas and lit candles and lamps. They gave us hot-water bottles to take to bed with us.

We can't really go back in time, not with cell service everywhere and hydroelectric plants providing power to the remotest regions. But if you want to really get a sense of what it was like to live in ancient times, when distances were measured in days and not kilometers and supply chains were severely limited by transportation capacity, the Khumbu is as good a place as any to experience that.
