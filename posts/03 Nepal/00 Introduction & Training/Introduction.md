# *Peripatos* in the Khumbu. 

**Everest Lodge-to-Lodge, April 28--May 9, 2025**

We did the [Everest Lodge-to-Lodge hike](https://www.wildernesstravel.com/trip/nepal-everest-lodge-hiking-tour/) in the spring of 2025. (Well, technically, we were on the [Everest Private Journey](https://www.wildernesstravel.com/trip/everest-private-journey/), but the itinerary is basically the same) [Wilderness Travel](https://www.wildernesstravel.com) did a great job of organizing it!

A good time was had by all!

## Ancient Perspectives

Part of [the point of the Peripatos project](https://eumaeus.substack.com/p/peripatos-2024-statement-of-purpose) was to get a sense of what travel and general human existence were like in ancient times, back when all land travel was done on foot - maybe an animal's feet, but still. We realized that much of the difference between then and now was the result of where wheels can go and where they can't.

When paths were narrow and rocky, walking was the only way to traverse them. The wheel, for all its advantages, couldn't go everywhere. 

The problem is that modern Greece isn't ancient. No matter where we went, we couldn't escape the wheel, usually attached to the internal combustion engine. Maybe that wasn't really a problem--we do enjoy modern comforts and conveniences--but it did keep us from experiencing a genuinely wheel-free society.

But! There are still a few places in the world where the wheel has yet to make an impact. In fact, there are places where the wheel will probably never take over because it simply can't.

Meet the [Khumbu Valley](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/blog/khumbu-region).

## The Khumbu and the way to Everest

Nepal is an interesting place. It's a modern country--everyone has a cell phone and just-in-time ride-sharing is totally a thing in Kathmandu--but it's also got one of the lowest per-capita national incomes in the world. There are roads and cars aplenty, but many of those roads are rough, to put it mildly. The city of Kathmandu is full of cute new restaurants and glamorous clothing (all those kurti and saris!!!!) but you can't drink the water, and the power goes out all the time.

The Khumbu region, also known as the Everest region, is northeast of Kathmandu. As the crow flies, it's not far, but it might as well be across the ocean as far as most transportation is concerned. To be fair, you can walk there. The first Everest expeditions did just that, hiking all the way from Kathmandu with an army of porters.

![Here's Mt. Everest.](images/IMG_6355.jpg)

But today, most people--tourists and locals--get to the Khumbu region by flying into Lukla. And once they're there, they walk.

This is because of the local geography. Remember how geography is destiny? The Khumbu region consists of the highest mountains and deepest river valleys in the world. It's simply not amenable to road-building. There are well-maintained trails aplenty, but they're full of steep and irregular steps, irregular rocks, sudden narrow bits, and other features that render bikes, carts, and ATVs out of the question.

## An entirely pedestrian culture

EVERYONE walks. 

Little kids walk to school, of course, but in the Khumbu they might walk six or seven hours to get there. Children in Pangboche or Phortse might go to school in Namche. They walk to Namche every Sunday, a six hour walk, holding hands with their siblings or friends if they have them--though some little ones walk alone. They stay in a hostel during the week and then walk back home for the weekend on Friday.

![Walking. Foreigners pay a lot to do the walking. Locals walk because they have to.](images/Deboche_trail_IMG_5743.jpg)

Adults walk to work, which might be two hours away. Up a mountain. They might or might not come back home every night.

Our guide Bala's two daughters go to school in Kathmandu. When they come home to Namche, they fly to Lukla and then walk a full day to get home. Bala's elderly mother has to do the same. 

There are donkeys, of course, and some people have horses. You generally don't see many people riding them, though. Some tourists end up riding horses due to injury or altitude sickness, but there don't seem to be any horse tours of the area. 

## Moving goods: beasts of burden

Without wheels, how do goods move around? How do shops stock their shelves, restaurants stock their pantries, builders stock supplies? 

Goods move on foot. Attached to backs. The backs might be attached to two or four legs.

Sure, some stuff comes in on planes and helicopters, and in 2025, drones started flying gear up to Everest. But the vast, vast majority of goods are transported the very old-fashioned way.

![Our porter, Mila Dai, carried our two duffel bags and the giant oxygen canister throughout the trek. When he got done with out load, he'd find extra work portering back to Namche or collecting yak dung in the hills around town.](images/Deboche_Mila_pace_IMG_5687.MOV) 

![Porters carrying construction materials up to Namche.](images/Namche_porter_IMG_5507.jpg)

![Donkey trains carry the majority of goods in the lower Khumbu, between Lukla and Namche.](images/Phakding_donkeys_gas_IMG_5303.MOV)

![Above Namche, yak-cow hybrids called jhopkyos do most of the carrying. Walkers are advised to watch out for their horns!](images/Pangboche_jokyos_IMG_5937.MOV)

Tourists have very mixed feelings about human porters. It's a hard job, to be sure. Bala told us that many porters won't carry water because that adds weight to their loads, and they want to maximize their paying loads. At night you can see the porters walking along the trails with headlamps; it is cooler at night, and if you can't carry water…

Our guide, Bala Bai, started his career as a porter. Then he became a high-altitude porter, then a high-altitude technical guide. Now he owns his own tour company, and his daughters are in private school in Kathmandu. We think it is quite likely he will end up Mayor of the Khumbu. So portering is a hard job, but both necessary up in the mountains and a valid pathway to a better life.

## Going back in time

Travel wasn't the only aspect of the Khumbu that resembled the past, distant and not-so-distant. There is ubiquitous electricity, but when it goes out, everyone is forced to rely on solid and present fuels. During the three-day Namche power outage, the lodges cooked with gas and lit candles and lamps. They gave us hot-water bottles to take to bed with us.

## Training: Table Rock State Park

It's a really good idea to train for the Everest Base Camp trek. A REALLY good idea. And the best possible training is hiking on rough terrain, ideally up and down mountains. 

Lucky us, we live 45 minutes from the perfect training ground: [Table Rock State Park](https://southcarolinaparks.com/table-rock). We hiked this weekly—there are a number of trails, and we mixed it up—for about eight months.

![We had to find other hikes when Table Rock caught fire. The incredible Park Service folks had the trails open, and new trails added (!) within three weeks of the fires. Amazing.](images/IMG_4846.JPG)

## The Beatles

Since we were driving out to Table Rock weekly we needed a project. So we undertook to listen to all the Beatles albums, in their entirety, in order. 

![The most under-appreciated Beatles album, their "country music" album, *Beatles for Sale*.](images/beatles_for_sale.jpg)

Amy has observed that while you still hear the Rolling Stones all the time on the radio or in movie soundtracks, the Beatles, for all their vaunted stature, don't really get played that much. The most-played Beatles song is "Here Comes the Sun", which interestingly is a George Harrison composition. "Twist & Shout" got a season in the sun because of Ferris Bueller. But that was, like, 35 years ago. *JoJo Rabbit* made the German version of "I want to hold your hand" ("Komm gib mir Deine Hand") a thing for about six weeks.

Random observations and notes: 

- "Taxman" and "Lady Madonna" don't appear on any of their albums, until later "Greatest Hits" compilations; they were just released as singles. 
- The above is strange, since the long-ass *White Album* has a bunch of crap on it, to fill out the double-album, that no one would ever want to listen to. "Revolution #9", we're looking at you! Why not put your fun, catchy songs there, and release the stupid avant-garde noise-nonsense as a single, for the seven pretentious people who might want to hear it?
- At their best, the Beatles were first a great pop band, then a great country band.
- George can play any style, and it was a pleasure to listen to him, the baby of the bunch, develop as an artist.
- Ringo is Chris' favorite Beatle. No drama, just solid talent and a willingness to put up with his band-mates weird nonsense.
- John was probably legitimately mentally ill, sick, mean, and nasty. We learned to identify "John-songs" because they were hateful and violent. "Run for Your Life" comes to mind. Also, "I am the Walrus." Not… healthy.
- "Sgt. Pepper" is a strangely conservative album. The only "love song" is "Lovely Rita, Meter Maid", which paints a scene of a "date-night" on a couch with Rita's sisters, presumably drinking tea or Pimm's Cup or something, and watching the BBC. Most of the songs are nostalgic for a domestic life that was being blown up by the 1960s. "She's Leaving Home" is as sympathetic to the parents as to the rebellious girl. 
- Chris likes the Sitar-stuff more than Amy does.
- "The Long and Winding Road" is terrible, and they deserved to break up after letting that out into the world.
- Ringo has a "seafaring" thing. Submarines, octopusses. Makes us like him even more. 
- George Martin was trully the "Fifth Beatle". We learned to identify his rollicking honkey-tonk piano. 
- Amy observes that George Martin couldn't be an official "Beatle" because he was 20 years older than the other four, and no one wanted to see a middle-aged man playing the piano in Shea Stadium.
- Chris' list of best albums: "Beatles for Sale", "Rubber Soul", "Revolver". They lost the script starting with "Sgt. Pepper". After that, it was three guys working on their future solo careers, with Ringo just coming to the studio, dropping a rigorously solid beat, and getting paid.

## Why this itinerary?

Everyone knows about the Everest Base Camp trek. This is the one where people walk all the way from Lukla to the actual base of Mount Everest, right under the Khumbu Ice Fall. Few tourists spend the night in the base camp itself; most walk there and back as a day trip from Gorak Shep, the last settlement on the trail before base camp itself.

But. The overwhelming impression I've gotten from reading numerous blogs and watching umpteen vlogs is that the last few days on the EBC route suck. People get cold, tired, and sick. The lack of oxygen (perhaps exacerbated by moving too fast?) really gets to them by the end. The accommodations are bare-bones and the food is increasingly monotonous. 

![Cold, but happy.](images/ip16-IMG_6135.HEIC)

Chris and I really like our comfort. By that, I mean we would at least like to have a private room to sleep in, and ideally an *en suite* bathroom. We like to have electricity in our bedroom so we can charge our devices at night.

The teahouses and Sherpa lodges that are the mainstay of EBC lodging don't guarantee those things. The toilets are shared, in some cases a single squatty potty for an entire floor. The showers are down the hall and you have to pay extra for them. There might not be electricity. Many places have a charging station in the dining room where guests can pay to charge their phones. The dining rooms are the only heated parts of the lodges, so they can get crowded with wet, muddy, possibly loud-mouthed tourists. 

We don't mind toilets down the hall from time to time, but we don't relish a steady diet of it. Though I'm sure our fellow travelers are charming people, and I know that meeting people from other lands is part of the wonder of travel, especially mountain dirtbag travel, but Chris and I do like to keep our own company. And daily showers.


We really don't want to have to bunk down on the benches in the dining hall. It doesn't have to be the Four Seasons, but sleeping with strangers is a bridge too far.

The [Everest Lodge-to-Lodge hike](https://www.wildernesstravel.com/trip/nepal-everest-lodge-hiking-tour/) itinerary duplicates the classic Everest Base Camp trek up to Pangboche--which is the last place on the route where there are "comfort" accommodations. After a brief glance up the trail that runs along the river (the Dudh Khosi) toward Lhotse, Nuptse, Sagarmatha (aka Chomolungma, aka Mt. Everest), it turns back west toward the Sherpa settlement of Phortse for a relatively comfortable night at altitude before heading back to Namche Bazaar by a different route. This cuts a few days off the full there-and-back trek while also providing some variety in trails and accommodations. 

## The value of extra time: oxygen and sleep

The beauty of the private journey we booked was that we could tweak the itinerary to our own tastes. The first thing I did was add a couple of extra nights to the walk. First, I added a third night in Namche Bazaar.

Namche Bazaar is the main "town" on the tourist trail. This is the spot where almost all trekkers spend a couple of nights to acclimatize and do any last-minute shopping. 

![Namche Bazaar](images/ip16-MMNT_LAPSE_20250430125108836.MOV)

The standard itinerary spends two nights in Namche. In my exhaustive pre-trek reading, I concluded that we'd give ourselves a better chance--both of avoiding altitude sickness and generally enjoying the trip--by staying there three nights. I have Ian Taylor Trekking to thank for this--they emphasize the importance of [sufficient acclimatization around the 12,000 foot mark](https://iantaylortrekking.com/blog/high-altitude-trekking-tips-for-success/), and the value of [three nights in Namche](https://iantaylortrekking.com/the-everest-region/sleeping-at-everest-base-camp/).

The normal Lodge-to-Lodge itinerary spends one night in Pangboche, during which trekkers can make an optional visit to Ama Dablam base camp. A visit to an actual climbing base camp that isn't a major tourist attraction seemed too good to miss, and tacking it on to a hiking stage (albeit the short stage from Deboche to Pangboche) sounded a bit too hectic. I added a second night in Pangboche, which gave us time to enjoy the walk from Deboche to Pangboche--you've never seen such stunning views of Ama Dablam!--and to spend a full day on Ama Dablam itself.

I also handled our own bookings in Kathmandu. Everest Lodge-to-Lodge ordinarily houses guests at the [Gokarna Forest Resort](https://gokarna.com). I wanted to stay near Thamel for our first weekend, both for shopping and to enjoy the Kathmandu vibe, which was a reasonable choice though I now appreciate why Gokarna would be ideal for "comfort" guests. I also wanted to spend a full weekend in Kathmandu before heading off to the mountains, both to breathe air at 4500 feet or so (it's not "high", but it's higher than South Carolina!) and to begin to get over the savage jet lag that comes with traveling 9.75 time zones. 

Nepal is nine (or ten, depending on time of year) hours and 45 minutes ahead of EST.

I understand why most itineraries fly people off to the mountains a day or so after they arrive in Kathmandu and why they don't linger in Namche. Vacation time and money are both limited in most cases, and it takes many days to reach Everest Base Camp in the best of circumstances. 

We, however, happened to have the luxury of an open schedule, so we took advantage of it. Whether it was a game changer, I can't really say, but I do wonder how much of people's difficulty sleeping at altitude is more a function of disrupted circadian rhythms than of altitude sickness per se. Certainly dashing straight to Lukla after a major international flight doesn't help with the matter of fatigue. We got tired enough even with our looser schedule.

### How thin is the air, really?

Thin. Not gonna lie, the altitude really makes things harder.

I noticed the lack of oxygen the moment we climbed out of the helicopter in Lukla. Walking through town to the Mountain Lodge felt alarmingly strenuous, though that could also have been jet lag and getting up at 4:15 a.m. 

I really felt the altitude during our days in Namche Bazaar. My heart was racing, I was breathing faster than usual, and I sometimes woke up in the night gasping for breath. It didn't help that my right nostril got completely clogged on the way up there, possibly the result of inhaling far too much donkey dung. 

![You can hear Chris huffin’ and puffin’ on our excursion above Namche.](images/ip16-IMG_6119.MOV)

Bala advocated wearing a buff over my face to keep out the dung dust, but that made me feel like I was suffocating.

Some people take Diamox to ward off altitude sickness. I didn't want to chance the side effects with a new sulfa drug, and I also didn't want to use a drug to mask physical symptoms that could be better addressed by addressing the actual problem, so we went drug-free. 

We just climbed slowly. That was always the solution. You can ALWAYS go slower.

Even when Bala declared us acclimatized and at no risk of any altitude-related difficulties, I still felt the lack of air. It wasn't until we flew back to Kathmandu that my heart stopped racing.

## How comfortable are the "comfort" accommodations?

Comfortable enough, definitely. Not Four Seasons luxurious, or even I-65 Comfort Inn luxurious, but plenty comfortable for our purposes.

We mostly stayed in properties owned by Mountain Lodges of Nepal, formerly known as Yeti Mountain Home. How I lament the change of name! 

![Our lodges were always warm and inviting.](images/ip16-IMG_7148.MOV)

The Mountain Lodges are great, some of the best places you can stay in the region. They all provide a high level of service, with happy hour before dinner every evening, plenty of hot water for drinking and filling water bottles, and generous meals.

The beds are comfortable and spacious, and they come with lots of covers. They also have electric bed-warming pads, which are great when the electricity is running. 

The rooms aren't heated. Hence the electric bed warmers/electric blankets. Nighttime temperatures dropped below freezing most of the time we were in the Khumbu (in MAY), which meant our rooms were darn cold. We appreciated pre-warmed beds.

The power was out several nights in Namche, which meant no warm beds. Bala had the staff give us hot-water bottles, which helped.

Most of these lodges advertise their hot showers. This should be taken with several grains of salt. To be sure, we had showers in our bathrooms. But the showers were heated with solar energy, and solar only works when it's sunny. At least half the time, it was cloudy, if not outright raining/snowing. The showers weren't very hot those days. Our third night in Namche, the electricity had been out for 24 hours and it had been snowing. We didn't even try to shower that day.

The hottest shower we had was in Pangboche. It was gas heated.

In Pangboche, we stayed at an Everest Summit Lodge, which was very nice. It has two categories of room, "comfort" and regular. It also has two dining rooms so the comfort guests don't have to mix with the riff raff.

In Deboche, we stayed at Rivendell Lodge. The newest Mountain Lodge has just opened in Deboche, so presumably future itineraries will stay there. Rivendell is more basic than the Mountain Lodges, more like a standard lodge; this was the only place where the dining room was actually full of guests. 

In Phortse, we stayed at a Sherpa Lodge. We shared a double room and used the toilet down the hall. No showers that day either.

Meals were excellent and plentiful. The Mountain Lodges served multi-course lunches and dinners and the staff would come around the tables with pots offering seconds of everything. Breakfasts were made to order; we came to favor the masala omelet. 

## Why Wilderness Travel?

There are piles of Khumbu Valley hikes available, at all kinds of price points. You can go [very expensive](https://climbingthesevensummits.com/ruggedluxury/). You can go super cheap, like this [Indian couple who traveled on $11 a day](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFC_Y-onfUMzU_PkSBmYeCL6tgq9hYBgB). Prices have gone up since Nepal instituted a guide requirement in 2025, although Bala told us that guides are still optional in the Khumbu.

The most bare-bones travelers just wing it, picking up a guide in Thamel or even Lukla and trusting that there will be space in teahouses on the way. At the end of the second-day walk to Namche, just the prospect of walking from the bottom of town to a booked hotel at the top is a daunting prospect; the thought of wandering from inn to inn like Joseph and Mary doesn't bear consideration.

They might carry all their own gear, though porters don't charge much for their labor. Cheaper tours come with big groups, with all that entails. Cheaper modes of travel also can involve more uncertainty about flights in and out of Lukla--one hears horror stories of folks being stuck in Lukla for three days, just waiting for a flight back to Kathmandu. 

The most expensive tours can come with luxuries like helicopter tours of Everest itself, or helicopter transfers from one place to another. Helicopters really add to the price, but there's no discounting the convenience of instantaneous transfers; lots of folks are happy to pay for a flight from EBC to Lukla when the only alternative is at least three days of (hard) walking.

Mountain Lodges of Nepal, which provided most of our accommodation, runs its own version of the [Everest Base Camp trek](https://mountainlodgesofnepal.com/journeys/everest-base-camp-trail/) with lots of helicopter transfers. Mountain Lodges also offers some thoughtful alternate options like the [Everest Sherpa Trail](https://mountainlodgesofnepal.com/journeys/everest-sherpa-trail/) that hikes as far as Deboche and includes a helicopter excursion to Kala Patthar and heli ride back to Lukla. This is not a terrible itinerary if your time is short.

We didn't want that level of luxury--we were there to walk in the mountains, after all. On the other hand, we did have a tight schedule, we needed to be back in Kathmandu on a specific date, and we do relish our privacy and our comfort.

[Wilderness Travel](https://www.wildernesstravel.com) hit the sweet spot for us. The Lodge-to-Lodge itinerary is all walking, there and back. We had a private guide who devoted himself exclusively to us, making sure we always had water and working his connections at the airport to make sure we got back to Kathmandu on time. He was one of the most experienced and smartest local guides, so we learned tremendous amounts just by listening to his lectures on culture and natural history. They also hooked us up with a local contact in Kathmandu; Pankaj got us through the visa process in mere minutes, ushered various family members to and from the (chaotic and mildly terrifying) Kathmandu airport, arranged multiple drivers with large vehicles, and even hooked us up with a dress shop on a Saturday. Wilderness Travel really did nail the balance between furnishing us the services we could actually benefit from and letting us handle ourselves as much as possible. No complaints there.

## Boots (or shoes) on the Ground: Practicalities.


Not gonna lie, getting to, into, and through the Khumbu valley is mui complicado. Here are some of the key things we had to think about on this trip.

### Getting into Nepal

Nepal requires all visitors to purchase a visa upon arrival. They sell them in 15-day and 30-day versions. Though our family members who came for the wedding after our trek managed with 15-day visas, Chris and I had to get the 30-day ones because we were in Nepal nearly a month.

You buy the visas at the airport, which adds a line to stand in the very moment you arrive in Nepal after an extremely long journey. It's best to arrive with exact cash in American dollars.

There are computer terminals where people can fill out visa forms before joining the lines. I hear that they don't always work, but our kids had no trouble. It's also possible to fill out the visa form online ahead of time.

![The first thing that struck us about Kathmandu was the telephone poles. They all look like this.](images/IMG_5324.MOV)

We sent our visa applications and photos to Wilderness Travel as part of the arrival service they offer. That meant that when we arrived, our local contact Pankaj had our visa forms in hand. All we had to do was hand him our fees. He went straight to the counter and got our visas in under a minute. To my mind, that was money well spent--you hear of tourists standing in line for two hours or more on particularly bad days.

### Gear

Here's what we carried:

1. daypack (Osprey Tempest 20 for Amy, 
1. Nalgene (fake, bought in Thamel) bottles
1. water blivets (2 liters; Chris had a 3-liter one)
1. sunglasses
1. Chris always carries random extra stuff: batteries, headlamps, knives, emergency blanket, Leatherman, para-chord, duct-tape, sporks,  &c. None of this was necessary, but he's not going into the wild (even the civilized "wild" like the Khumbu, without enough stuff to survive a night outdoors). 

### Clothes and Shoes

First, shoes, which are the most important! Both of us wore Altra Lone Peaks throughout the trek. Trail runners!

![Here you can see Amys' load-out. She's got her Altras, and a tiny, light pack. We can't pat ourselves on the back, though, because Mila Dai was carrying 50kg of our other stuff in the duffles. Bless him!](images/ip16-IMG_5752.MOV)

How did this go, you ask? Didn't we miss the ankle support and protection of hiking boots?

No, we did not miss any aspect of hiking boots. We don't miss the stiff soles and the tight toes and the need to break the things in, and we certainly don't miss the weight.

We've worn Altras exclusively on all our multi-day treks in the Alps, Greece, the Blue Ridge.... Since 2016, neither of us has worn anything else. 

Altra's shoes are shaped like feet. They let our toes spread, which is vital for balance and for general comfort. They're zero drop, so they don't tip our bodies off balance with elevated heels. They are shoes, not boots, which allow our ankles to rotate freely. (This is a good thing--ankle joints are there to allow little adjustments. Neither of us has ever sprained an ankle.) They're lightweight, which makes it easy to move quickly and to drag our feet up steps and steep slopes.

Amy used to wear Altra Superiors, which have the lightest cushioning of all Altras, but those don't work anymore. (Altra has a habit of tweaking their perfect designs and rendering them useless.) Chris has always loved Lone Peaks. Lone Peaks do seem to be the sweet spot of enough cushion to avoid pain from walking on rocks without losing groundfeel and hence proprioception.

Altra does sell some waterproof designs, but we don't generally use those. Do our feet get wet? Sometimes. It's not a big deal.

Amy

1. Hoodies in cooling fabrics (Patagonia capilene cool, Salt Life)
1. Baseball cap
1. Sunglasses
1. 2 light leggings (1 lululemon, 1 Crz Yoga)
1. 2 fleece leggings (Crz Yoga makes reasonably priced ones)
1. 1 pair loose pants
1. 1 pair shorts (to wear over leggings)
1. Mountain Hardwear Ghost Whisperer (superlightweight down jacket; also super packable.)
1. Marmot Polartec Alpha jacket from several years ago (active insulation)
1. Arcteryx Delta Light jacket (best lightweight fleece, also from several years ago)
1. Lululemon define jacket
1. Mountain Hardwear stretch ozonic raincoat
1. 2 Uniqlo heattech shirts (lightweight longsleeves for insulation)
1. 2 Uniqlo airism bra camis (as bra/undershirts for every day)
1. Coolmax toe socks (4 pairs?)
1. 1 pair thin Uniqlo heattech socks to wear on top of toe socks on Ama Dablam

![The Ghost Whisperer is one of the lightest layers around but it doesn't work well when it gets wet. Chris' synthetic insulation was better.](images/Puffers_IMG_5587.jpg)

![Active insulation is the strong suit of Polartec Alpha (Amy's green Marmot jacket) and Chris' Arc'teryx Atom.](images/Marmot_ip16-IMG_6327.jpg)

![We broke out the raingear in Khunde and Khunjung.](images/Raingear_IMG_5640.jpeg)

### Staying clean

Though we didn't expect to have a modern, urban level of hygiene, no one wants to stink or wear dirty clothes. Many guesthouses in the region have single showers in the hall, shared by all guests, and perhaps charge for their use. We chose our itinerary partly for the promise of en suite bathrooms nearly everywhere.

The showers in most places were serviceable. Temperatures ranged from genuinely hot (the gas-powered shower at Everest Summit Lodge in Pangboche, at least when the knobs were set right) to genuinely cold (Mountain Lodges of Nepal Namche on a day when the electricity had been out since the previous night and the day had been mostly cloudy.)

![Our spacious and comfortable room (even with no electricity) in Namche Bazaar.](images/ip16-IMG_5275.HEIC)

There were a couple of days we simply chose not to shower. Baby wipes are a reasonable alternative. My attempts to use dry shampoo weren't terribly satisfying, though some people like the stuff.

One night we were promised two buckets of warm water in our room. Those failed to materialize, which was just as well because the room was so cold I doubt we'd have been able to make good use of them.

We'd worried about putting in contact lenses, but sinks and mirrors were never a problem. This might be more difficult further up the trail and certainly would be a consideration while camping, but that didn't come up for us.

We both regularly wash out clothes and hang them to dry while traveling. That's not entirely practical in the Khumbu, where room temperatures can be in the 40s. It takes stuff forever to dry. The technique of washing stuff at night and putting it back on still damp the next morning (I've done this throughout the Alps) is less pleasant when breakfast rooms are near freezing, though it can be done.

The one time we had the hotel in Namche do our laundry, it took two days to get it back due to a power outage. It did return very clean, though, and the price for the service was quite reasonable.

### Staying warm

It's cold up there! Vlogs and blogs always feature people in puffers shivering uncomfortably, but bloggers are bad about sharing the dates of their treks. I figured many of these must have taken place in March or October, which should be cold. May, on the other hand, is spring! Surely it wouldn't be cold then?

![Walking above Namche to the Hillary School on May 1st.](images/ip16-IMG_6162.MOV)

Well, early May is cold. We got snowed on TWICE. 

Staying warm outside is a matter of gear, covered above. But what about staying warm inside? 

Bedrooms are freezing. We usually had electric bed warmers, but those didn't work the nights that Namche lost power. The beds have thick blankets, so if you get into them warm, they'll stay that way. But the rooms themselves are COLD--a good motivation to dress quickly in the morning.

The public rooms are heated by stoves, which are not always lit. We spent lots of time at meals wearing down jackets over fleece. Several light layers work well, especially because once the stoves get going, the room can get uncomfortably hot.

I struggle to keep my feet warm. I brought down leg warmers, which I wore almost all the time, including on the trail; down booties, which I wore in bed; and sheepskin boots, which I wore instead of the provided slippers in the lodges. 

The cold never left us. I'd intended to leave most of my warm stuff with Bala in Namche Bazaar on our way back to Lukla but ended up keeping it til the very end simply because I needed it.

### Is it scary?

Before booking our trek, the first thing I asked Hunter at Wilderness Travel was whether the EBC trail has much scary exposure. She assured me that it doesn't. She'd just hiked our route and it wasn't scary at all! 

I didn't entirely believe her. People who aren't scared of heights can't identify the bits that will frighten those of us who are. There's a whole range of acrophobia, much of which can be very situational and idiosyncratic. 

I booked the trip anyway. Chris had always wanted to see Everest. I figured I'd spend a certain amount of time terrified and would somehow muscle through. The fact my skeleton isn't still stuck on top of the Sefinafurga in Switzerland is testament to the fact that I CAN get through high passes without psychically combusting.

But it's no fun to spend much of a vacation scared out of your wits. My doom-scrolling through blogs describing scary trails didn't increase my confidence. I envisioned getting paralyzed halfway between Pangboche and Phortse, unable to move forward. I imagined having to revise our entire itinerary to stick to the trails I was capable of walking. 

That was all a waste of time.

The truth is, I was never scared of heights in Nepal. It wasn't nearly as scary as many sections of the Haute Route or the Via Alpina in Switzerland, and certainly not as scary as the most exposed trails in Crete. 

Part of this was down to width. Like many people who fear exposure, I struggle most with narrowness, which forces one to walk on an edge from which it would be easy to imagine plunging. But if a trail is wide enough, that edge feeling goes away. The trails in the Khumbu are the region's highway system, built for trains of pack animals and people who use them for their weekly commutes. They are almost always wide enough for two people to walk abreast. 

The trails are also of high quality. Another thing that terrifies me is walking on narrow, dusty trails that are slanted downhill. This isn't completely irrational; it's very easy for a foot to slide on dust and loose gravel. But the trails in the Khumbu are well maintained, often paved with large stones. We didn't walk on very much that was both steep and slippery.

Then there was Bala Bai, our guide. I told him up front that I don't like exposed heights. He assured me that this wouldn't be a problem. This was in part clever guest management; he did keep one announcement of an upcoming scary bit back until the last possible moment, though it turned out that even that section of trail had just been rebuilt. But there's also the possibility that I was so focused on not embarrassing myself by not inconveniencing Bala that I failed to register anything that might have scared me if we'd been hiking alone. I don't think so, but this can't be ruled out.

In any case, for anyone worried about acrophobia, I at least never noticed edges.

Suspension bridges are another issue. I didn't expect to be scared of them and I wasn't. Many people, however, do struggle with these things, and they are unavoidable. YMMV.

### Is it hard?

Yes. The Everest Base Camp trail is hard. It's about Tour de Mont Blanc or Via Alpina difficulty--the shorter daily distances are canceled out by the thinner air.

You have to climb. All the time. Everything is uphill, it seems. Just walking around Namche Bazaar is strenuous exercise.

!["Nepali flat" is the jocose term for "not really flat at all, but not straight up."](images/ip16-IMG_6729.MOV)

The trails are good and well-maintained, but they are rough and rugged too. You have to watch every step. 

But mainly, it's very hard to walk for long hours and to climb thousands of meters a day at low oxygen levels. We trained as much as we could, but we had no realistic way to prepare for thinner air. (It's possible to train for altitude, as our xenon Everest summiters demonstrated, but that requires a serious commitment to sleeping in a hypoxia tent for months and otherwise using gear to restrict oxygen.) 

Fatigue can build up. By the time we got to Pangboche and Phortse, I craved rest and tried to lie down and/or sleep whenever I could. Even on our "luxury" trip, we got worn out.

### Water

We drank a lot of water. A LOT of water!

It's a tenet of high-altitude travel that dehydration increases the risk of altitude sickness. Whether this really means people need to drink ten liters of water a day, or that just makes everyone need to pee, I don't know, but we weren't taking any chances. Bala certainly wasn't.

The water out of the taps isn't safe to drink, so all the lodges provide jugs of hot water in the rooms. We drank hot water with meals--it's considered beneficial for the health. 

![Even with our elegant "Yeti Punch", we always had hot water. Lots of hot water.](images/ip16-IMG_7207.heic)

Every morning, I mixed a packet of LMNT chili lime electrolyte powder in a one-liter Nalgene bottle and drank it with my creatine pills before leaving the room. (The creatine was meant to enhance performance on the trail. It might have been responsible for our severely chapped lips that developed late in the trek, so I'm not sure it's the best idea.)

At breakfast, we drank several cups of tea and/or coffee, along with the ubiquitous hot water. Bala would fill our blivets and Nalgenes before we left, and he made sure we drank regularly along the trail. 

We didn't get altitude sickness, so I guess it worked. But the subject of hydration leads me to another, related topic.

### Toilets, town and trail

TLDR: Bring packs of tissues and wipes. 

Toilets. Yes.

So, the mountain lodges have fine western toilets in the lobbies and in the rooms. They aren't meant to take toilet paper, so the proper behavior is to throw paper in the trash can. It's only gross at first; you get used to it pretty quickly. (Greece is like that too.) Also, "flushable" wipes should never be flushed anyway.

We have no pictures for this section.

Restaurants and more basic lodges typically have squatty potties. Some of these are primitive indeed; occasionally you find one with a pile of pine needles next to a hole in a wooden platform, meant to cover droppings that can then be used as fertilizer. Others have a barrel of water with a pitcher in them, which you use to flush by hand.

On the trail itself, toilets were sometimes a challenge. Much of the trail is very populated, and Bala could get us permission to use the toilets at various teahouses. There are some public toilets; sometimes there's one you have to pay to use, and a more primitive (or filthy) free one. The wipes are especially handy for cleaning one's hands after these places.

In less-developed areas, we looked for convenient trees or rocks. These trails are very busy, so it was sometimes hard to find a place with the requisite privacy. 

We drank so much, sometimes it seemed that we were like dogs or cats, marking our territory all the way up and down Ama Dablam.

### Money

On the trek, most of our expenses were pre-paid, but we had to pay for any extras like drinks, laundry, snacks, and wifi in some places. 

Some lodges will take credit cards, but card readers don't work without electricity.

We ran out of Nepali money buying expensive Sherpa-brand t-shirts and gifts in Namche Bazaar (using cash because the power was out), and we couldn't get more before leaving Namche (because the power was out). We got by with a combination of credit cards when possible and American cash. Using dollars isn't a problem.

There really isn't that much to spend money on, and we didn't want to add to either our own loads or to our porter's. 

### Connectivity

Connectivity was almost never a problem. We had good signal nearly everywhere, and since we weren't downloading movies or whatever people are doing now, we didn't spend a fortune on it.

Everyone in the Khumbu has a phone and is in constant contact with their people.

The lodges had wifi, but wifi only works when the electricity is on. The mountain lodges provide free wifi. Other places will sell a wifi card; those systems provide varying degrees of actual connection. We paid for a card in Pangboche that we probably needn't have, because signal worked just as well.

### Power

TLDR: Bring some batteries. Not too many.

For the most part, charging our phones and ipads wasn't a problem. (Laptops stayed in Kathmandu. Really, no porter should have to carry a laptop, and a trekker shouldn't take on the extra weight either.)

We could even plug in our chargers straight into the outlets. They fit US plugs. We'd brought adapters with us, but they were unnecessary in Nepal.

The problem was... the power went out for three days in the Namche region. This sort of thing is unpredictable but maybe also inevitable. So it was a good thing Chris had packed several batteries, including some solar-powered ones. (Solar-powered battery technology might not be all there yet; they just took too long to charge to be worth carrying. Bala has those now.)

![Visiting the North Face Store in Namche, with no power. Our second day up in Namche. You can here Chris huffing and puffing.](images/ip16-IMG_6057.MOV)

But we didn't need all the batteries he brought to Nepal. The night before we left Kathmandu, we concluded that the biggest and heaviest ones just wouldn't fit in the luggage (15 kg weight limits for ALL luggage, including daypacks), so they stayed behind to keep the laptops company.
