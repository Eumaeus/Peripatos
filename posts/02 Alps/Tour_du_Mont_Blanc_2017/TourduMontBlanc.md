# Tour du Mont Blanc, July 28 -- 30, 2017

By Amy Hackney Blackwell

The [Tour du Mont Blanc](https://www.alpineexploratory.com/holidays/tour-du-mont-blanc.html) (TMB, for those in the know) is one of the great Alpine summer walks. The traditional route starts in Chamonix and circles counterclockwise around the Mont Blanc massif in 11 one-day stages.

The Tour du Mont Blanc is a classic for a reason. It's hard but not TOO hard, and it has a little of everything!

## Cols

Lots of days on the TMB feature passes, called "cols". The typical day on this route starts low, begins with a climb up to a col, and then descends to the next night's accommodations. Though the TMB is not as col-centric as the [Via Alpina](https://www.alpineexploratory.com/holidays/via-alpina.html) (which Alpine Exploratory used to call the Alpine Pass Route), the cols are a remarkable feature. When you crest a pass, a new vista suddenly appears, stretching for miles into the future. You can turn around and see the entire route you've just walked, like gazing into the past. Some people get addicted to crossing passes for this reason.

Some cols are knife-edged ridges with super-steep approaches on either side, typically paved in tons of scree (I'm looking at you, [Sefinafurgga](https://www.hikingwalking.com/index.php/destinations/sw/sw_bernese/lauterbrunnen/sefinen_pass!). The cols on the Tour du Mont Blanc are not like that. With the exception of the [Fenêtre d'Arpette](https://www.thehiking.club/routes/fenetre-darpette?srsltid=AfmBOop9WxNTsZLx6WvCzn136whep9cYc1LrMjrURwFLLn5TmUnKHPFB), which can easily be skipped, TMB cols are broad and fairly flat. They provide approaches that are challenging but not scary, lots of space to hang out on top, and great views in all directions.

## Refuges and Huts

Alpine tourists talk about staying in "huts" and "refuges," which gives the impression of bare wood shelters that might consist of a platform, roof, and thin walls, or perhaps no walls at all. Though there are facilities like that in the Alps, those are not what is means by "hut" or "refuge." 

Huts, refuges, and the related auberges are a combination of hostel and hotel. Lots of them have private bedrooms, sometimes with en suite bath facilities, sometimes with bathrooms and toilets in the hall. They might have rooms of dorm accommodations, with multiple bunkbeds lined up. Some have platforms lined with mattresses, where travelers cozy up to one another.

What you get depends at least partly on what you pay.

Almost all these places have a heavy emphasis on food. They serve hearty, multi-course dinners, typically at communal tables. People buy carafes or even bottles of wine -- no civilized European dines without wine! 

We chose Alpine Exploratory's "comfy" mix, which put us in hotels wherever possible, but it wasn't always possible. Probably half our nights were in some form of hut/refuge/auberge. It was fine. Most of time, we had rooms to ourselves. When we didn't, it was all right -- just one night of lousy sleep won't do lasting harm, and the communal arrangements are meant to be part of the "charm" of Alpine trekking.

Not gonna lie, we prefer our own space. But at least we never had to camp, and we made some of our best trekking friends at those communal dinners.

## About us

![Amy and Chris up above Chamonix](images/AmyChris_IMG_6281.jpeg)

Chris (49) and Amy (47): we have lived in South Carolina since we got married back in 1996. We don't climb fast, but we can keep going for hours. We dislike camping so much that we once walked the Art Loeb trail in one 18-hour shot just so we wouldn't have to sleep out. We hiked the north part of the TMB in 2016 (8 stages, Courmayeur to Les Houches) and liked it so much we came back to do the whole thing in 2017.

Here are the essentials:

* Outfitter: [Alpine Exploratory](https://www.alpineexploratory.com). We got the [self-guided TMB](https://www.alpineexploratory.com/holidays/tour-du-mont-blanc.html) comfy mix (more hotels, fewer dorms) with luggage transfer.
* Shoes: Altra Superior (Amy) and Altra Lone Peak (Chris). Altra are our perennial trekking go-to -- wide toe boxes, completely flat, light weight, no ankle or arch "support." Zero foot pain and excellent balance over all terrains.) Amy used compression sleeves to prevent calf and shin pain.
* Packs: Osprey Skarab 24 (Amy), Deuter Act Trail 30 (Chris)
* Cameras: iPhone 6s (Amy), Fuji Fuji XE-2 with Fuji XF 18mm f2 and Fuji XF 35mm f1.4 (Chris)
* Raingear: Marmot PreCip jackets and pants. It rains a lot in the Alps!

What we didn't carry:

* Much of anything. A light pack and light shoes make for happy hiking!
* Trekking poles. They use up energy and they prevent us from using our hands to scramble. I'd be more sympathetic to claims that they help with hiking if 99% of trekkers on the TMB didn't appear to have zero notion of why they are carrying the things.
* Painkillers. We figure if our gear hurts us, we need different gear. Muscle soreness goes away with time.
* Food. Seriously, we didn't carry food with us. We have found that a low-carb high-fat (LCHF) diet with intermittent fasting works very well for performance and weight maintenance. We ate a small, high-fat breakfast (in Italian refuges Amy would eat buttered cheese) to minimize morning insulin spikes (we wanted our fat stores to be readily accessible) and then walked for five or six hours, stopping once for coffee. Around 2 we'd have lunch at a refuge or restaurant, followed by as much as we wanted for dinner. Strict low-carb or paleo is very difficult to do in these circumstances, especially in mountain refuges, and fasting from dinner til lunch impractical, so we were flexible. We felt great and had plenty of steady energy for walking - way better than when we used to constantly fuel up with sweet snacks.

## Getting there: Arrival in Chamonix (July 18)

This trip started like many of our trips with a drive to the Charlotte airport. Lufthansa has long run a regular flight direct to Munich, which makes a great way to enter Europe; Munich's airport is extremely efficient, and the city itself is conveniently located near a range of further transportation options. 

Our departure from Charlotte was delayed two hours due to thunderstorms. This meant that we missed our connection to Geneva, but Lufthansa immediately moved us to the 2:15 flight and gave us vouchers for lunch in the airport.

In Geneva, we caught an [Alpybus](https://www.alpybus.com) rideshare to take us into the mountains. The best part of the ride was the continuous loop of extreme skiing and wingsuit flying videos.

In Chamonix, we stayed at the [Hotel l'Oustalet](https://www.hotel-oustalet.com), just like last year. We dined at same restaurant as first night last year and probably ate the same thing –- terrine, steak, ice cream, rosé wine, yay!

## Day 1: Les Houches to Les Contamines (July 19)

![We passed the Bionassay glacier.](images/Bionassay_glacier_IMG_4839.jpeg)

16.7 km, 826.7 m ascent, 1,403.6 m descent

Today we began our daily morning routine: breakfast at the hotel followed by quickly packing our suitcases so they'd be ready for pickup by the luggage transfer guys by 8:30. This system works extraordinarily well, and we've never had a problem with transfers anywhere in the Alps.

The classic TMB route starts in Les Houches, a town just south of Chamonix. We took a bus from Chamonix to the Bellevue stop in Les Houches. This took longer than we'd intended because the first bus we took was heading north toward Argentiére, not south toward Les Houches -- a typical jet lag mistake. In any case, it gave us the opportunity to make a dinner reservation at the wonderful restaurant Beurre Noisette for our return the following week and also to buy a bottle of (expensive!) sunscreen in a pharmacy.

![We used the Bellevue cablecar to skip the first 1000 meters of climbing -- the only automation we used in the whole route!](images/Cablecar_IMG_4791.jpeg)

Jet lag never does good things to our basic intelligence. We got off the cablecar and immediately headed in exactly the wrong direction for 15 minutes. We then got to spend another 15 minutes retracing our steps to where we'd started.

![When we returned to the Hotel de Bellevue, Amy insisted on a short nap before proceeding on the correct route.](images/Hotel_Bellevue_DSCF2382.jpeg)

Eventually our circadian rhythms kicked into daytime mode and we became less stupid. That was good, because this was a beautiful day of hiking!

![The alternate Col de Tricot route gave us the chance to cross the exciting Himalayan Bridge.](images/Himalayan_bridge_DSCF2405.jpeg)

![We had lunch at the Refuge de Miage. I did not regret the fried potatoes!](images/Day1_lunch_DSCF2452.jpeg)

![We encountered our first rental mule.](images/Rental_Mule_IMG_4907.jpeg)

The mother of the family renting this beast expressed some scorn that we'd never heard of such a business arrangement; EVERYONE rents donkeys and mules, she said.

![We finished today's stage in the ski town Les Contamines.](images/LesContamines_IMG_5086.jpeg)

## Day 2: Les Contamines to Les Chapieux (July 20)

![There was a donkey/mule rental stand on the way out of Les Contamines.](images/RentaMule_IMG_5120.jpeg)

19.4 km, 1,315.5 m ascent, 1,015.8 m descent

This was a hard day. We started by climbing, and climbed some more to the Col de Bonhomme, and then kept on climbing to the Col de la Croix de Bonhomme. We ate lunch. Then we got to go down. That was nice.

![This southern section of the TMB is mostly undeveloped.](images/Col_de_Bonhomme_wilderness_IMG_5019.jpeg)


![Almost to the Col de Bonhomme.](images/Approaching_Col_de_Bonhomme_IMG_4998.jpeg)

![Uplift](images/Uplift_IMG_5034.jpeg)

![We had lunch at the refuge at the Col de la Croix de Bonhomme.](images/Refuge_Croix_Bonhomme_IMG_5031.jpeg)

![So many sheep!](images/Bonhomme_sheep_IMG_5056.jpeg)

We finished in Les Chapieux, a settlement that basically consists of two refuges that are only open in the summer. A little shop sold local specialties. We bought some cheese, nougat, and an Opinel knife. We also bought a glass jar of local terrine, which turned out to be a ridiculously heavy and unnecessary addition to our packs.

![Les Chapieux](images/LesChapieux_IMG_5078.jpeg)

We stayed at Auberge de la Nova, where meals are communal and the showers and toilets are in the hall, though our room did have a sink. 

![Auberge de la Nova](images/Auberge_dela_Nova_DSCF2602.jpeg)

We had a fun dinner conversation with some Norwegians who were mountain biking the TMB -- they'd carry their bikes uphill and then ride them down. I can't imagine another more simultaneously grueling and terrifying!

![What could possibly go wrong?](images/Mountainbike_IMG_5221.jpeg)

## Day 3: Les Chapieux to Cabane du Combal (July 21)

![Welcome to Italy!](images/Italy_welcome_IMG_5250.jpeg)

18.5 km, 1,140.5 m ascent, 775.7 m descent

Oh, my calves were sore this morning!

Lots of our fellow guests at the Auberge de la Nova in Les Chapieux took vans up the road to la Ville des Glaciers (neither a city nor particularly glacial), but we are purists so we walked up through the valley. We saw a whole family of marmots playing! 

![Heading back north](images/Leaving_Chapieux_DSCF2633.jpeg)

After the previous day's climb, this walk felt relatively easy, even if it was on the longer side.

![We stopped for coffee at the last refuge in France.](images/LastFrenchRefuge_DSCF2668.jpeg)

![They have a unicorn!](images/Unicorn_IMG_5123.jpeg)

The climb up to the Col de la Seigne was cold and windy. The views from the col were gorgeous, though the clouds were closing in. We were entering a new country -- Italy! We also walked back into signal as we crested the pass -- so many messages awaited us on our phones!

![Climbing up to the Col de la Seigne.](images/ColdelaSeigne_approach_IMG_5170.jpeg)

![It was windy! The weather clearly changed on the other side of the pass.](images/Windy_coldelaSeigne_DSCF2734.jpeg)

![The walk took us through a hanging valley lined with wild gentians.](images/HangingValley_IMG_5296.jpeg)

[Rifugio Elisabetta](https://www.rifugioelisabetta.com) is the usual nighttime stop on this stage, but we were going further, to the [Cabane de Combal](https://cabaneducombal.com/en/). We stopped at the Rifugio to have a quick lunch of spaghetti bolognese. This gave us an opportunity to check out the accommodations we might have had and to feel happy we weren't staying there. The bedrooms were crammed with densely packed bunks, and the whole place smelled like socks and farts.

![Rifugio Elisabetta is situated right under a glacier.](images/Rifugio_Elisabetta_IMG_5318.jpeg)

![A thunderstorm kicked up as we walked out of the refuge.](images/Elisabetta_storm_IMG_5337.jpeg)

We made our way another hour or so down the trail to the Cabane de Combal. We were slightly anxious about this place, which we feared might be even more rustic than Rifugio Elisabette -- what on earth might that look like?

![It rained the rest of the afternoon.](images/Combal_rain_IMG_5347.jpeg)

![Approaching the Cabane de Combal with some trepidation.](images/Cabane_Combal_IMG_5381.jpeg)

Our fears were ungrounded. The Cabane was newly built, bright pine, and we had a double room with an en suite shower, as luxurious an accommodation as any we'd experienced. It's much smaller than Rifugio Elisabetta, so there weren't the crowds you sometimes see in refuges.

That night I tried the local herbal liqueur called Génépi, a lovely wormwood-infused digestivo said to re-oxygenate the muscles. I quickly decided that I would become a Génépi fiend!

![Génépi, or Genepy, is a species of chartreuse, made only in the Alps.](images/Genepi_IMG_5352.jpeg)

## Day 4: Cabane du Combal to Courmayeur (July 22)

![We awoke to a beautiful sunny day!](images/Cabane_morning_IMG_5388.jpeg)

13.6 km, 506.7 m ascent, 1,238.9 m descent

This was a super easy day with maximum beauty, just a gorgeous balcony walk with gorgeous views of the Mont Blanc massif. Instead of a dedicated rest day, we just had a short day's walk.

![Even an "easy" walk involves climbing.](images/Amy_massif_DSCF2872.jpeg)

![Looking back south toward the Cabane de Combal.](images/BacktoCombal_DSCF2858.jpeg)

![The glaciers have been melting. The snouts are all far above the beds -- we were level with them over 2000 meters.](images/Glaciers_DSCF2921.jpeg)

![The descent into Courmayeur was long, though. We regretted not taking the ski lifts down.](images/Courmayeur_IMG_5529.jpeg)

We stayed in the [Hotel le Bouton d'Or](https://hotelboutondor.com/en/), where we'd stayed the previous year as well. We were back in familiar territory; last year, we'd started the Tour in Courmayer. (We took the bus from Chamonix through the Mont Blanc tunnel; I kept my eyes the whole time to avoid reflecting on the horror of the [1999 fire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mont_Blanc_Tunnel_fire).)

It was nice to have a long afternoon in Courmayeur. We did laundry, which dried quickly on the balcony. We shopped at our favorite outdoor goods shop, where I bought a new Camelback; it seemed that my Osprey blivet was leaking, though that might have been user error. We had a spritz and Campari shakerato (Campari shaken with ice) at a café before dining at La Terrazza, the restaurant our hotel had recommended to us last year as well. Despite the Italian name of the restaurant, Courmayeur doesn't give off a major Italian vibe, at least not in its tourist-facing side. It feels more like southern Switzerland, the way Zermatt does but in a much more low-key way. There's certainly no need to speak Italian there!

![Courmayeur commerce: a little outdoor gear, a lot of booze.](images/Courmayeur_shops_DSCF3014.jpeg)

![Courmayeur house of sport, where you can get compression socks and hydration bladders, etc.](images/Courmayeur_house_of_sport_IMG_5541.jpeg)

![Aperol spritz, the drink of summer in the Alps.](images/Spritz_IMG_5539.jpeg)

![La Terrazza seemed to be the main "nice" restaurant in town. I suppose more places might be open in the winter, during ski season.](images/La_Terrazza_DSCF3020.jpeg)

Back at the hotel, we sat in the lobby and chatted with an English couple who was also hiking in the area. Though Alpine hiking is unfamiliar territory for most Americans, the Brits and Germans have been stomping up and down those hills for decades if not centuries. Our great discoveries are just vacation as usual for them.

## Day 5: Courmayeur to Rifugio Elena (July 23)

![A pretty balcony walk!](images/Gentian_trail_IMG_5668.jpeg)

22.2 km, 1,425.3 m ascent, 679.1 m descent

This was a long day. And we were just tired. This happens, even with rest days. It's hard to keep going day after day. Some days are just hard, and it's even harder if the tired days coincide with long days. As this one did.

The walk NEVER got easy. 

As we walked out of Courmayeur and ascended toward [Rifugio Bertone](http://www.rifugiobertone.it/wp/en/home-en/), we remembered the same climb the previous year, when we hadn't known what to expect and were full of fear that the climbing would be too hard and that we didn't have all the things we'd need. We were more relaxed about logistics this time -- you don't really run into real wilderness or solitude anywhere on the TMB -- but our legs definitely felt the uphill. A long afternoon in town apparently wasn't enough for full recovery.

![Looking back the way we'd come; you can see all the way back to the Col de la Seigne.](images/Back_toward_Courmayeur_DSCF3191.jpeg)

Last year we'd hit Bertone so early in the day that we went ahead and did the gorgeous, high Mont de la Saxe variant, which took us through the most gorgeous Alpine scenery. Last year we'd spent our first night in [Rifugio Bonatti](https://www.rifugiobonatti.it/en/), a classic accommodation on that stage, but this year it was was fully booked. Alpine Exploratory had booked us into the next realistic accommodation, Rifugio Elena. This made today's hike ... longer. 

![Rifugio Bertone is a classic coffee stop right out of Courmayeur. All the UTMB training people stopped there.](images/Bertone_crowd_IMG_5544.jpeg)

![Bertone from above.](images/Down_on_Bertone_IMG_5555.jpeg)

We thought we could make the walk easy by taking the Via Armina balcony path from Rifugio Bertone to Rifugio Bonatti instead of the high climb over Mont de la Saxe. Ha! The the TMB is NEVER not hard. It was a slog. 

![The balcony trail contours around the hillsides. This makes it look flatter than it really is.](images/Balcony_IMG_5572.jpeg)

As we dragged ourselves along, we were passed by numerous guys RUNNING the damn thing, presumably training for the UTMB later in the season. (Winners clock in at 22 hours....) 

The worst moment was when we'd basically arrived at Bonatti but were still 100 meters below the refuge. Never have I felt so heavy or my legs so leaden.

![Rifugio Bonatti. Finally.](images/Bonatti_IMG_5626.jpeg)

![We had a nice lunch, though. It was nice to be in a familiar place.](images/Bonatti_lunch_IMG_5628.jpeg)

![Alpine cats seem very healthy.](images/Bonatti_cat_IMG_5632.jpeg)

After lunch, we continued. For hours. In my recollection, it only took us about two hours to walk to Elena from Bonatti, but this walk felt endless, especially the final climb to the refuge.

![The runners and their dogs seemed happier than we did.](images/UTMB_training_IMG_5684.jpeg)

![Heidi's Grandpa might have lived in this hut, except he was Swiss and this is still Italy.](images/Hut_IMG_5657.jpeg)

[Rifugio Elena](http://www.rifugioelena.it/pagine/ilrifugioen.html) is a large, popular refuge with large dorms. If they had private rooms, those were not available to us. All the toilets are squatty potties, and the bathroom floors are contiguous -- showers and toilet splashes all drain into the same central drain, at least as far as I can tell. 

Like all alpine refuges, Elena has an extensive bar and common areas. Reluctant to make new "friends," I sought refuge in *Game of Thrones* on my phone. Also in Genepy.

![Rifugio Elena lies under this glacier.](images/Glacier_Elena_IMG_5667.jpeg)

## Day 6: Refugio Elena to La Fouly (July 24)

![I'd say a Hail Mary!](images/LaFouly_chapel_IMG_5721.jpeg)

14.2 km, 452.7 m ascent, 913.3 m descent

Oh, dorms. The bed was comfortable enough, to be sure, but I am much too old to bunk down with high school students and vigorous Germans. We were both up early.

Breakfasts in Italian refuges are especially sugary carb-heavy, with lots of white bread and marmalade and dry cookies. We'd been carrying our Savoie terrine for several days now, since we bought it in Les Chapieux. This was the perfect time to break it out and eat it for breakfast -- some good salt and fat, and now I didn't have to carry that heavy-ass glass jar.

Today was a short walk. Which was nice, because it rained the whole way. And turned cold. 

![We walked out into a light rain and clouds.](images/Ferret_mist_IMG_5354.jpeg) 

![The view back to Col de la Seigne was just an expanse of gray mist.](images/BacktoCol_de_la_Seigne_IMG_5353.jpeg) 

We climbed up to the Grand Col Ferret and into Switzerland. The previous year, this climb had been a great challenge of this trip. This time, we barely noticed when we reached the top -- partly because we couldn't see it, and maybe because we did this first thing in the morning, and perhaps because last year that was on our second day of hiking, but maybe we were getting stronger?

I sweated through my shirt and my down vest, which promptly stopped providing any insulation whatsoever and required me to switch out jackets. We both find that down is not the greatest insulator in the Alps, which tend toward constant dampness.

The clouds persisted as we walked the flattish trail to the La Peule refuge. We arrived at the buvette too early to need food, though we did make us excellent omelettes last year. We got coffee while the girls prepped cheese for the day's orders.

![We drank so much coffee on the TMB. It's always a good excuse to stop someplace for a rest.](images/La_Peuly_coffee_IMG_5720.jpeg)

![They make massive amounts of raclette, omelettes, and related cheese-oriented cuisine.](images/La_Peuly_cheese_IMG_5718.jpeg)

It was an easy albeit misty walk down the road to La Fouly.

![This is pretty much La Fouly, as seen from Hotel Edelweiss.](images/La_Fouly_IMG_5726.jpeg)

This year, we stayed in [Hotel Edelweiss](https://www.fouly.ch/en/). La Fouly is barely a town, but this hotel is an actual hotel with en suite bathrooms, unlike the auberge where we stayed the previous year. (Well, that place had showers in the rooms, but they were clear plastic pods right next to the beds, which made showering ... awkward.) We took nice warm showers and rinsed out our clothes. All hotels in the Alps turn off their heat during the summer, there was zero chance that wet clothes would dry on their own, but the room supplied a hair dryer, which was useful.

We had osso bucco and steak frites for lunch in the hotel restaurant. After a nap, we visited the outdoor store outlet. Chris got a North Face fleece jacket and a Patagonia fleece vest -- very finance bro. I got a Patagonia Nano Air hoody. This was a bit too warm for most of this trip, but it did become one of my favorite jackets over the next few years, so it was a good purchase.

![My new hoody getting some action on Alp Bovine.](images/Jacket_DSCF3479.jpeg)

After dinner in the hotel that night, we spent a quiet night in our room. It was nice to have a sort of rest day after yesterday's epic slog.

## Day 7: La Fouly to Champex (July 25)

![Today was a valley walk through Valais.](images/Valley_Valais_IMG_5811.jpeg)

16.3 km, 464.4 m ascent, 560.2 m descent

This stage is the easiest of the TMB, but for some reason lots of people skip it and take the bus. That's a shame, because it's such a pretty walk through Swiss Valais, land of precisely stacked woodpiles!

The day started drizzly again. 

![We walked along road through Valais –-  this was very nice, much better than slipping and sliding along that muddy trail.](images/LaFouly_drizzle_IMG_5359.jpeg)

![Maybe taking the bus in the rain make sense after all....](images/LaFouly_bus_IMG_5736.jpeg)

We took it easy today, stopping first for coffee and then for lunch in the town of Issert. This part of Valais is distinguished by several villages that are historic, or UNESCO world heritage sites or something -- anyway, they contain a bunch of old, wooden houses and massive woodpiles. 

![House and woodpile](images/House_IMG_5808.jpeg)

![This page in a book in a café is funny.](images/ConceptualArt_IMG_5746.jpeg)

![This sign in the toilet in Issert is also funny.](images/Pisser_IMG_5820.jpeg)

![We discovered the hydroelectric plant's warning sign after we'd bushwhacked into its empty riverbed -- oops.](images/Hydroelectric_IMG_5777.jpeg) 

![There are lots of donkeys here.](images/Donkey_IMG_5789.jpeg)

We concluded the days walk with a stiff climb through the woods up to the town of Champex. It was a pleasure to revisit the realm of regional spokesanimal Charlotte la Marmotte with her passion for mycology and to try another hotel in Champex-Lac, the lovely [Hotel Alpina](http://alpinachampex.ch) with its friendly owners and excellent cuisine, though we are still fond of the [Hotel Splendide](https://www.hotel-splendide.ch) next door.

![Charlotte la Marmotte, the local spokesmarmot](images/Charlotte_IMG_5421.jpeg)

![Dinner at Hotel Alpina](images/Hotel_Alpina_DSCF3356.jpeg)

![And the clouds rolled back in during dinner.](images/Clouds_back_IMG_5450.jpeg)

## Day 8: Champex to Trient (July 26)

![Sunny morning in Champex-lac](images/Champex_DSCF3376.jpeg)

23 km, 737.9 m ascent, 947.3 m descent

The previous year, we'd done the "easy" Alp Bovine route to Trient. This year we'd intended to do the more challenging Fenêtre d'Arpete, but at the last minute, the cold weather and our hostess persuaded us not to go up that high. No matter, the Bovine route is challenging enough, AND its buvette is one of our favorite restaurants. 

![The morning was chilly!](images/Champex_chilly_IMG_5854.jpeg)

We felt strong now. A week of daily hiking will do that....

![It wouldn't be Alp Bovine without cows everywhere!](images/Alp_Bovine_cow_IMG_5912.jpeg)

On one mountainside all the trees have been recently knocked down by some great violent force. If I were at home I would guess a microburst or tornado, but here I suspect avalanche is more likely.

![A storm -- or avalanche? -- must have come through.](images/Bovine_storm_IMG_5468.jpeg)

![Stopping at the Alp Bovine buvette is a high point of this route.](images/Buvette_DSCF3472.jpeg)

![If it weren't for the clouds, we could see down into Martigny.](images/Alp_Bovine_Buvette_DSCF3474.jpeg)

![After the clouds cleared, we could actually see Martigny and some of the Rhone valley/Bernese Oberland.](images/BerneseOberland_IMG_5940.jpeg)

![It looks higher than it is.](images/Gate_DSCF3483.jpeg)

We finished the day's hike in Trient, where we stayed at [La Grande Ourse](https://www.valleedutrient.ch/en/la-grande-ourse-fp53) (The Big She-Bear), same place we stayed last year. 

![Trient](images/Trient_IMG_5948.jpeg)

It seemed that the same dissatisfied tourists were there too, sharing the same meal of spaghetti with us in the crowded dining room. This is another place with bathrooms in the hall. Chris reported that the Japanese tourists were prone to wandering around the men's room naked.

![What did you expect to see on Alp Bovine?](images/Cows_IMG_5908.jpeg)

## Day 9: Trient to Argentière (July 27)

23.4 km, 1,032.1 m ascent, 1,135.9 m descent

Breakfast at [La Grande Ourse](https://www.valleedutrient.ch/en/la-grande-ourse-fp53) can be a bit grim. This morning, the self-service room was packed with grumpy trekkers. There seemed to be no place else to get coffee in town, so we were kind of stuck. I personally started my day with buttered cheese -- a keto favorite, and nicer than corn flakes and white bread.

![What does one do in Trient?](images/Trient_IMG_5956.jpeg)

Today's walking region is one of the most beautiful of the entire TMB. The route crests at Col de Balme, where you get a view back into the Chamonix valley. Last year we'd done the regular route, straight from Trient up to the col and then to Argentiere by way of the Aiguillete des Posettes ridge walk. That was a long day! 

This time, we took the alternate route past the Trient glacier, by way of the Chalet des Glacier and Réfuge des Grands. You can get to the Fenêtre d'Arpette from here if you want to head back to Champex. For some reason I thought this variant would be longer but easier. It wasn't!

![The Chalet de Glacier isn't much of a chalet, but it is possible to spend the night here in a teepee!](images/Chalet_glacier_IMG_5520.jpeg)

![This route presented more steep climbing and exposure than I'd anticipated!](images/Steep_IMG_6046.jpeg)

![The Réfuge des Grands is one of the more remote and rugged refuges.](images/Grandes_IMG_6051.jpeg)

![Lots of the trail between the Réfuge des Grands and Col de Balme was rocky and rough like this; we had to use our hands more than usual, though it's not unlike the Aiguiette des Posettes ridge walk.](images/Climb_IMG_6087.jpeg)

Our intermediate destination was the refuge at the [Col de Balme](https://www.autourdumontblanc.com/en/accomodations/list-of-accommodation/refuge-du-col-de-balme). We'd planned to eat lunch there, a goal that began to seem elusive the longer it took us to traverse the distance!

![It's so far away!](images/Distant_ColdeBalme_IMG_6132.jpeg)

![Finally made it!](images/Col_de_balme_IMG_6139.jpeg)

We were right to worry about the time. We stumbled in a few minutes before 2, with just enough time to order the lunch special of steak frites. A pair of hikers who arrived just after us were denied this succor, and had to make do with Snickers bars.

![Steak frites on the Col de Balme.](images/Col_de_Balme_lunch_IMG_6141.jpeg)

From the Col de Balme, we walked straight down the valley to Argentière. It was already well into the afternoon, so there was no realistic possibility of doing the Col des Posettes again. Even so, this was one long-ass walk!

![We're heading back south, returning to our starting point in Chamonix!](images/To_Argentiere_IMG_6164.jpeg)

![It's impossible to get lost on these trails. These signs are everywhere throughout the Alps.](images/Sign_IMG_6156.jpeg)

We spent the night at the Hotel [Les Grands-Montets](https://www.hotel-grands-montets.com/en/), where we'd stayed the previous year; it has a surprising American western style decor. The hotel got us an early dinner reservation at our favorite restaurant in Argentiere, [La P'tite Verte](https://la-ptite-verte-restaurant-argentiere.eatbu.com/?lang=en).

## Day 10: Argentière to La Flégére (July 28)

![We've mostly made it around the circuit!](images/Accomplishment_IMG_5569.jpeg)

12.4 km, 1,155.9 m ascent, 541.4 m descent

One drawback of doing the "comfy" mix of accommodations is that nice hotels are in towns, which tend to be located in convenient valleys some distance from the trail. The TMB proper is up above Argentière -- WAY above it. 

![First, you go up! Then you can start hiking.](images/Above_Argentiere_IMG_6221.jpeg)

The previous year, we were feeling tired at this point, and we were also out of money, which we would need for our night in a refuge. We couldn't find an ATM in Argentière, and there certainly wouldn't be one at the evening accommodations. So we walked through the valley, heading south in the direction of Chamonix. It was a beautiful walk, and it certainly made for an easier day, with the added advantage of sorting our finances, but this year we wanted to do the real thing.

We climbed up, up, up to reach the trail. The trail heading south in these parts gets surprisingly technical. There are a number of ladders that must be ascended to proceed. I'd been nervous about them, but they proved to be no big deal. Even old people go up and down the things -- it's best to watch out for their bouncing trekking poles. 

![Some ladders.](images/Ladders_IMG_6225.jpeg)

![You really do have to climb some of this stage.](images/Climbing_IMG_6230.jpeg)

![The height increases the sense of exposure.](images/High_up_DSCF3846.jpeg)

We stopped at [Lac Blanc](https://en.chamonix.com/activities/hiking/lakes-waterfalls-and-gorges/hike-to-lac-blanc-from-the-index-cable-car), a beautiful alpine lake on the high ridge. Here, we suddenly encountered hordes of tourists who had come up to spend the day in the fresh mountain air, enjoying the beautiful mountain scenery. Chamonix is a major tourist center, and with ski lifts running year-round, it's possible for almost anyone to visit the higher locations. 

![The refuge at Lac Blanc, popular with tourists.](images/Lac_Blanc_IMG_6345.jpeg)

We ate lunch at the relais on the shore of the lake. I had to stand in a long line to use the toilet.

![Outdoor dining near the mountaintop.](images/Lac_blanc_table_IMG_6353.jpeg)

After lunch, we descended toward [La Flégére](https://www.refuge-de-la-flegere.com/en/home/), one of the old classic mountain huts high above Chamonix. A great crowd of other tourists was walking the same route, which remained surprisingly difficult. This part of the trail has sections made of large boulders more or less placed flat; I always find the footing on these things uncertain, though European hikers blast across them.

![We could see back to Col de Balme!](images/Back_to_Col_Balme_IMG_6382.jpeg)

![La Flégére](images/La_Flegere_IMG_6411.jpeg)

At La Flégére, we were given the same bunks we'd occupied the year before.We had a couple of roommates, but everyone seemed to sleep reasonable well that night. This building is very old. It has electricity, but you can't count on finding an outlet available for charging devices. The bathroom is a shared facility at the end of the hall.

![We had a nice time at the communal dinner.](images/LaFlegere_dinner_DSCF4018.jpeg)

We met a French dad who'd come up to spend a night in the mountains with his two middle-school aged children (the mom was spending the night in town). We chatted with them until almost 11.

## Day 11: La Flégére to Chamonix (July 29)

![Our last mountain morning!](images/Last_morning_IMG_6400.jpeg)

15 km, 509.6 m ascent, 1,299.8 m descent

Mountain huts exist so that hikers and climbers can wake up right on the trail, without having to add a long commute first thing in the morning or at the end of the day. This morning, our new French friends were going to hike that trail north to Lac Blanc, whence we'd come yesterday. We were heading south to Pranplaz on the Grand Balcon Nord. This trail continued to be harder than we expected!

![We said goodbye to our friends outside the refuge.](images/Flegere_morning_DSCF4085.jpeg)

![This trail stayed rugged.](images/Rocky_DSCF4096.jpeg)

![There were great views of parapenters.](images/Parapente_DSCF4126.jpeg)

![This part of the trail is dotted with ski lifts that keep running in summer.](images/Ski_lift_IMG_6451.jpeg)

![We stopped for coffee at a ski lift café.](images/Coffee_IMG_6455.jpeg)

Then we did our one cheat of the entire TMB (well, our second cheat, since we'd started with a ski lift from Les Houches). The route officially ends where it began in Les Houches. But Les Houches is past Chamonix, and we were staying in Chamonix that night. The prospect of walking well past Chamonix on more rugged mountain trails only to have to take a bus back was not attractive at all.

![I mean, Chamonix is right down there!](images/Chamonix_right_there_IMG_5627.jpeg)

Though we're not TMB purists, we did want to feel like we'd accomplished something real. So instead of doing what we'd done the previous year and taking a ski lift down to town, we walked. All the way down.

Anyone who thinks descending mountains is quick is deluded. Even if you don't have to pick your way down, the distance alone takes time to cover. Chamonix turned out to be ten kilometers away by trail, a walk that took us over two hours.

And then we were done! We had lunch in town. We checked into our hotel and cleaned up. I bought a wonderful kids' graphic novel about the history of tourism in Chamonix. 

![This was the last night I could be photographed with a glacier in the background.](images/Amy_IMG_5646.jpeg)

![A river runs through Chamonix. It cools the town like an air conditioner. The milky color is due to a high mineral content.](images/Chris_IMG_6473.jpeg)

We had a lovely dinner at [Beurre Noisette](https://www.chamonix.net/english/generic/Restaurant-Beurre-Noisette/172292), where the proprietor comped us two shots of chartreuse "pour réoxygene les muscles."

We spent dinner plotting next summer's adventure -- maybe it was time for the Haute Route. Chris did so long to see the Matterhorn!

(Lest this account give the impression that all of our treks go perfectly, I can say that we did indeed embark on the [Haute Route](https://spark.adobe.com/page/ch9bK255ts5nY/) the next year. It did NOT go well at all!)

## End of TMB and Salzburg (July 30 -- August 2)

![Waiting for the Alpybus.](images/Boutond'or_IMG_6476.jpeg)

And that was the end of our 2017 Tour de Mont Blanc! 

Further adventures awaited before we returned home. We were headed to Salzburg for a few days, where we were going to meet up with our kids. The plan was to fly from Geneva to Munich and then take the one-hour train ride into Salzburg. Should've been easy peasey.

Ha!

The good thing about Europe is that if something goes wrong with an airplane itineray, there are other options. 

The Alpybus was 15 minutes late picking us up, but that wasn't the actual cause of our problems. We arrived at the Geneva airport to encounter a madhouse, a seething mob of tourist families all attempting to check in for their flights. There were long lines everywhere, there was no indication of which line was for what airline, and there appeared to be no one in charge. 

After standing in line without moving long enough that it became apparent that we would definitely miss our flight, we gave up on these paid-for plane tickets and walked across the street to the train station. 

![We got to make a surprise visit to Zurich!](images/Zurich_IMG_6479.jpeg)

The trains were crowded on a Sunday in late July, especially as we approached the popular tourist areas. The train from Zurich to Salzburg was delayed by thunderstorms and trees down on the track. The restaurant car ran out of food.

![My dinner, courtesy of the ÖBB Austrian railway.](images/Train_dinner_IMG_6491.jpeg)

But all was well in the end. We got to Salzburg around midnight and were met by our son, who had collected the key to our room. We had a lovely couple of days exploring the town before heading back to the U.S.

![Beautiful Salzburg.](images/Salzburg_IMG_6555.jpeg)

And we were confirmed in our decision to bail on our flight from Geneva. It turned out that Geneva airport's automated baggage system had broken that morning, and humans were checking in bags by hand. Those souls fortunate enough to pass this hurdle then had to wait for the airport's extremely inefficient security screening. I doubt we could've flown that day at all, and in any case, it's more fun to ride a train through Central Europe than it is to stand in line in an airport, especially in a line full of thousands of overstressed British and German families. Thank goodness we had a choice this time!
