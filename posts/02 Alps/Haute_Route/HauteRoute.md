# The Walkers' Haute Route, 2018 

By Amy Hackney Blackwell

This trip was supposed to be like the [Tour du Mont Blanc](https://www.alpineexploratory.com/holidays/tour-du-mont-blanc.html), only more so. 

We'd done the TMB in 2016 and 2017, and had started to think we were ready for more challenge. When the TMB gets too easy, the Haute Route is the logical next choice - higher, longer, awesomer. 

Heck, reading through the itinerary, we even thought some of the stages might be TOO short and leave us with time on our hands. We thought we might get bored.

We were cocky fools. We had no idea what we would face on the Haute Route, which is NOT just one step up from the TMB in difficulty.

But overconfidence wasn't the worst of our problems. We'd have gotten through and enjoyed the walk. But there are worse things than being a little tired or scared on a mountain path.

Sometimes nothing goes according to plan.

## The Walkers' Haute Route

The [Walkers' Haute Route](https://www.alpineexploratory.com/holidays/walkers-haute-route.html) is a high-altitude trek from Chamonix to Zermatt, connecting two world-famous Alpine resort towns by a long-distance trek that runs south of the Rhone Valley up and over multiple mountain ridges and through multiple valleys. It's famous for having some of the most beautiful, wild scenery of any trek through the Alps.

It's also HARD. Alpine Exploratory lists this as the [hardest of their Alpine treks](https://www.alpineexploratory.com/holidays/walkinggrades.html) by some measure. Unlike the TMB, the Haute Route doesn't go through many towns with restaurants and hotels. There are no charming cafés with WCs, though there are lots of rocks to pee behind. The paths aren't as well-trodden, and in some parts they aren't completely clear. The distances are long with no easy outs, and often there are no realistic ways to shorten stages. 

The route crosses lots of passes. Some passes are broad and flat and fairly easy to tackle. Others are high, steep, loose, and very narrow at the top. Those are scary and difficult.

![An easy pass: the approach to the flat, grassy, gentle Foopass on the Via Alpina (not on the Haute Route).](images/Foopass_IMG_6568.HEIC)

![The Meidpass on the Haute Route, a pass that fits somewhere in the middle. It's reasonably strenuous to walk all the way up there and down the other side because the distance is long and the elevation changes are significant, but not profoundly frightening or slippery.](images/Meidpass_IMG_8660.jpeg)

![Climbing a ladder to get to the scary-ass Sefinafurgga on the Via Alpina (this isn't an Haute Route pass, but it's representative of scary passes!)](images/Sefina_ladder_IMG_7870.HEIC)

![The knife-edge Sefinafurgga itself. That's really all there is of this pass.](images/Sefina_IMG_7879.HEIC)

There is exposure. Though some of the scarier bits can be eliminated -- the Europaweg on the last two days is one section some people choose to edit -- some can't. (One of my recurrent fantasies is getting to a section of trail on which I become completely paralyzed, unable to more forward or backward. I will just die there, and future hikers will have to walk past my skeleton.)

![Rounding a bend heading toward the Matterthal, right on the edge!](images/Edge_IMG_9052.jpeg)

There are sections of ladders. See above re: exposure. Though we had no difficulty with ladders on the TMB, the ladders at the [Pas de Chèvres](https://www.alpenwild.com/staticpage/ladders-on-pas-de-chèvres-haute-route-trail-update/) (goat path) occupied my brain on multiple sleepless nights before we arrived in Switzerland. (If I'd seen this [2023 video](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=pas+des+chevres+arolla&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8#fpstate=ive&vld=cid:e00a49be,vid:TefPCMT5odU,st:0) before booking, I might have chosen another hiking trail! It's not the ladders that frighten me so much as the cliff-edge trail they hike to reach them.) 

There's an alternative to the Pas de Chèvres called the [Col de Riedmatten](https://www.hikingwalking.com/index.php/destinations/sw/sw_valais/les_hauderes/pas_de_chevres), which is said to be even higher and so steep and loose it's hardly easier (i.e., safer) than those ladders. (As it happened, we didn't hike that section, so all my pre-trip fretting was for naught.)

There is scree. There are boulders. The TMB doesn't have much of that high mountain rocky terrain, so I had no idea what we'd be facing on this route. Higher passes can be steep and loose, i.e. fields of deep scree at pretty vertical slopes. That stuff is hard to walk on and presents a real danger of slipping. The [Europaweg](https://www.europaweg.ch/en/) is notorious for rocks falling from above -- a risk that's impossible to mitigate. (Hikers are advised to just walk fast.) This terrain has the added benefit of being kind of ugly.

![The descent from the Sefinafurgga involves about an hour of walking through a steep and loose scree field.](images/Sefina_scree_IMG_7893.HEIC)

![Rocky terrain on the approach to the Augstbordspass.](images/Augstborgpass_approach_IMG_8959.jpeg)

![Typical bit of rocky trail descending from the Augstbordspass. Note how ugly and gray the pass itself looks in the background!](images/Augstbordspass_descent_IMG_9047.jpeg)

Even where the walking is straightforward, there are large sections that are hours away from any civilization or aid. Distances can be shockingly long.
 
Really, no one should belittle the Walkers' Haute Route. 

Were we up to it? Probably. We didn't walk the whole thing, so there's no telling. My guess is that if we had both been in good health, I would've been scared some of the time, we both would've disliked walking on gravel, we would've been tired a lot, and we would've made it through just fine. But we'll never know.

## Paris July 20-22

We started by flying to Paris.

Starting in Paris made sense. Our son had been studying French over the summer, and we were looking forward to spending a weekend getting over our jet lag by eating at our favorite restaurants and wandering around our favorite city. Paris makes a good gateway city for hikes. (Don't even get me started on Geneva's airport....) The plan was to arrive on a Friday and spend the weekend doing tourism with the boy and helping him move out of his dorm. Monday, he would fly home. Chris and I would TGV to Switzerland and start walking.

What happened instead: The Friday we landed, Chris came down with a high, high fever. 

![The next morning, he showed me THIS:](images/Arm_IMG_7780.jpeg)

![I did what one does in France: I took the gang to the pharmacy across the street to ask their opinion.](images/Pharmacy_IMG_7789.jpeg)

The pharmacist took one look, exclaimed "C'est une infection!!!!", and ran to the phone to call the ambulatory urgent care service. (Listening to this phone call, I remarked to the guys that I must have misunderstood because I thought the pharmacist had said the doctor would come to the hotel. That was, in fact, what she said. As an American, that was hard to believe.)

Within the hour, a doctor had arrived at our hotel room, diagnosed cellulitis, and prescribed oral amoxicillin. Shortly thereafter, a phlebotomist arrived to draw blood. Except for the walk across the street to the pharmacy, Chris never had to leave the room.

By Sunday, Chris felt so much better that I went to the Gare de Lyon and bought TGV tickets to Martigny for the next morning. (From a kiosk!) We were set to start the Haute Route.

![No trip to Paris is complete without the obligatory trip to Berthillon for ice cream.](images/Berthillon_IMG_7930.jpeg)

Before we left, I emailed Alpine Exploratory to ask them to cancel our two upcoming nights of mountain huts (Stages 2 and 3, since we were starting our trek in Champex -- the nights in Cabane du Mont Fort and Cabane de Prafleuri) and replace them with extra nights in Le Châble and Arolla. Spending three days in the high mountains didn't seem smart, and I thought Chris would be more comfortable in a bed than a dorm.

## To Champex, Monday July 23

![A lovely Swiss lake](images/Lake_IMG_7837.jpeg)

The full Haute Route from Chamonix to Zermatt takes two weeks of walking. The first three stages are the last three of the TMB in reverse, and we'd already walked from Champex to Chamonix twice. To save some time, we decided to skip those days and had Alpine Exploratory begin our arrangements in Champex, where Stage 4 of their itinerary begins. 

![We left from the Gare de Lyon.](images/GaredeLyon_IMG_7810.jpeg)

We took the TGV from Paris to Geneva and then a smaller train to Martigny.

![Martigny, which we soon knew much better.](images/Martigny_IMG_8054.jpeg)

We could've taken another train and local bus to Martigny from Orsières if we didn't mind traveling another two or three hours. But Chris was clearly exhausted so we paid a cab to drive us up the hill to Champex. This ride cost about $100 and was totally worth it. (The driver said the fare would be "Nonante." Chris immediately understood this to mean 90 euros. I did too, until I realized that "nonante" is NOT a French word. He was Romanian.)

I noted the minotaur statue in the Martigny town square, assuming that this would be the closest I'd ever get to this town that I'd only glimpsed from Alp Bovine on the TMB. Little did I know that Martigny was soon to become my new home base.

At our old favorite [Hotel Alpina](http://www.alpinachampex.ch), Chris got into bed. I went out to walk around the lake.

![Looking down toward Orsieres and the route we'd walked through Valais the previous two summers.](images/Orsieres_IMG_7814.jpeg)

![Hotel Splendide, as splendid as ever.](images/Hotel_Splendide_IMG_7817.jpeg)

![Tourists enjoying the lake portion of Champex-Lac.](images/ChampexLac_IMG_7821.jpeg)

We hoped a good meal and a good night's sleep would set us up to start hiking the next day. But Chris was too sick to eat. I ate most of his dinner on the sly just to make our hosts feel good about how they'd taken care of him.

## Stage 1: Champex to Le Châble, Tuesday July 24

![It was like walking in the Shire.](images/Stage1_valley_IMG_7870.jpeg)

Champex to Le Châble is a very easy stage, mostly flat and only 13 km, with a couple of potential outs on train lines, making it perfect for a convalescent. 

![A lovely example of Swiss vernacular architecture.](images/Chable_house_IMG_7891.jpeg)

The arm, though - the redness was spreading. 

![This does not look good.](images/Arm_Chable_IMG_7867.jpeg)

The Internet said the redness could get worse before it got better. Chris felt strong. (Sort of.) He was on antibiotics. He could soak his arm in the town water troughs. He could eat. (Sort of.) Surely -- he was fine?

![The cool water was soothing.](images/Trough_IMG_7881.jpeg)

But I ended up taking some of the weight from his pack, and he was grumpy as we passed a rock quarry. Grumpiness is never a good sign. 

![Entering Le Châble](images/Chable_church_IMG_7917.jpeg)

We got to Le Châble early enough for a nice nap. I bought some lotion from the pharmacy, but the skin on his arm was getting tight and the whole thing was hot and red, and lotion didn't look likely to help. The French antibiotics didn't seem to be doing much, either.

We tried not to worry. 

![Relaxing with local Partridge Eye wine.](images/Chable_wine_IMG_7922.jpeg)

## Stage 2: Above Verbier, Wednesday July 25

![We're in Verbier!](images/Verbier_sign_IMG_7945.jpeg)

Today's stage on the Haute Route consisted of walking from Le Châble or Verbier up to the [Cabane du Mont Fort](https://cabanemontfort.com) -- a walk that goes straight up the whole way, and that lies entirely under an operational cablecar. Die-hard hikers love this stuff, but to us it seemed like an exercise in perversity.

We didn't need to do a pointless climb to "up there." We were spending another night in Le Châble, so we didn't need to reach any destination. The hotel gave us free passes to the téléphérique, so we took the cablecar up to the ski slopes and spent the day doing the high bits of that day's walk.

![Looking down on Le Châble as the cablecar whisks us up to Verbier, where we caught another cablecar up to the high slopes.](images/Chable_cablecar_view_IMG_7937.jpeg)

Verbier is the real tourist destination here. Le Châble lies below it; I think we were staying there because it's much cheaper. (Verbier is fancy.)

![The clouds in the background are ominous. That's one of the things that makes the Haute Route especially challenging; it's hard to navigate in a fog.](images/Chable_trail_IMG_7977.jpeg)

![Cabane du Mont Fort, where we were supposed to sleep tonight.](images/Cabane_Mont_Fort_IMG_7988.jpeg)

![The path not taken -- tomorrow we would've been walking straight into that gray stuff behind me.](images/Verbier_path_to_mountains_IMG_7991.jpeg)

![Chris did all this hiking with his arm in a makeshift sling; we should suggest that Buff add another application to the multiple uses of their product!](images/Verbier_Chris_IMG_7995.jpeg)

We took the cablecar back down to Verbier, where chanterelles and abricots were in season.

![A typical summer menu in Verbier.](images/Verbier_menu_IMG_8027.jpeg)

![Our leisurely lunch of chanterelle fondue and chanterelle omelette, followed by apricot parfaits.](images/Verbier_lunch_IMG_8028.jpeg)

It was a magical day. But when Chris took off his shirt that afternoon, his right arm was red and swollen from short-sleeve-tan-line to fingertips. Clearly something had to be done. 

We agreed that we'd head to Martigny first thing in the morning to consult more medical professionals before taking the train on to Arolla, where we were set to spend the next two nights.

Neither one of us slept well. We both hoped we hadn't left this til too late.

![Le Châble felt desolate that evening.](images/Chable_evening_IMG_8036.jpeg)

## Stages 3-6: Martigny, Thursday July 26 - Monday July 30

![Martigny Hospital](images/Hospital_IMG_8111.jpeg)

I was up as soon as it was light, as if by my own force of will I could physically transport us to medical succor. We shoved our things in our bags, sucked down coffee, left our suitcases at the hotel door for luggage transfer on to Arolla, and were at the train station by 8:30 for the ten-minute ride to Martigny. 

We walked straight to the Pharmacie de la Gare to ask the ladies what to do. They sent us to Vigimed, an urgent care place, where it seemed that Chris would be released with just a change of antibiotics -- perhaps doxycycline -- when the doctor saw his blood tests. "The news is very bad, my friend," he said, and next thing we knew, we were walking to the hospital. (The doctor reassured Chris that the doctor at the Martigny hospital was one of the world's experts on these infections, "even though she is a woman.")

Within the hour, Chris was on a gurney in the emergency room with IV amoxicillin dripping into his arm. I was on the phone with Alpine Exploratory, getting our bags delivered to the hospital instead of Arolla and rearranging our arrangements yet again. The doctor said two nights in the hospital, so I had them cancel both nights in Arolla. We would rejoin the trek in La Sage, I told them.

I realized with dismay that I'd have to call our health insurance company. That was a grim moment. But by 2 pm, the guarantee of payment had come through, our bags were at the hospital front desk, and Chris was installed in a double room with big windows and lots of fresh air and natural light.

![The nurses were cute, too.](images/Hospital_bed_IMG_8051.jpeg)

Just as I thought everything was getting settled, I discovered that there were visiting hours -- and they were about to end. I was banished.

But! We must carry on. I found myself a seventh-floor single room in the hotel across the street from the hospital -- a romantic garret in which to wait out our separation and cry myself to sleep. And though Martigny and the hospital were strange and sad at first, we both got used to our new lives.

![My hotel.](images/Martigny_hotel_IMG_8173.jpeg)

![Stroll around the grounds until you feel at home.](images/Hospital_grounds_IMG_8055.jpeg)

Our schedules revolved around Chris' IV drips - 8 a.m., 2 p.m., 8 p.m., 2 a.m. Thursday morning til Monday afternoon (yeah, that's four nights, not two), Chris sat in the bed while nurses brought ice packs. The doctors would visit in the morning and make pronouncements -- your blood looks better. Maybe you can go today! No, actually, now you have a fever so you can't go.

The fevers came and went. Chris slept. I watched two seasons of *The Crown*. He watched endless *Breaking Bad* and *Better Call Saul*. (The hospital wifi was excellent; the summer patient population being fairly geriatric, we were probably the only people using it. I imagine it gets heavy use during ski season.) He could leave the hospital, so we went out to get salads at the Migros food court or pizzas in the town square.

![Big news in Valais.](images/Martigny_news_IMG_8074.jpeg)

I ate my solitary diners at Steakhouse Martigny. The owner's husband had spent a month in the hospital with an infected arm, so we were kindred spirits. 

![By the last night, I didn't even need to order - they just brought me my usual.](images/Steakhouse_Martigny_IMG_8100.jpeg)

We'd hoped to leave Saturday to make it to Arolla in the morning and resume our walk. That was not to be. Chris was feverish all day Saturday, the day we should've walked from Arolla to La Sage. 

By Sunday, the day we were supposed to walk from La Sage to Cabane de Moiry, he was feeling good, but no one gets released on Sunday. He spent the day basically as an outpatient, returning to the hospital only for his 2 p.m. drip. 

We explored the town - starting with Barryland, where there were St. Bernard puppies!

![St. Bernard puppies are BIG!](images/Puppies_IMG_8136.jpeg)

![An old Roman amphitheatre](images/Martigny_amphitheatre_IMG_8156.jpeg)

![The old Café des Alpes](images/Martigny_cafe_IMG_8163.jpeg)

![Martigny is so much sunnier than the higher areas above the Rhone Valley.](images/Amy_Martigny_IMG_1203.JPG)

Martigny is lovely, and everyone there was very kind. If we had to stall out for a hospital stay, it was a really nice place to do it.

![Goodnight, Martigny! Thanks for everything!](images/Martigny_night_IMG_8062.jpeg)

## Stage 7: Martigny to Zinal, Monday July 30

Monday morning we were nervous nellies. Would Chris have a fever? Would the doctor let him out? SHOULD the doctor let him out?

The doctor let him out. She said he could carry on with oral amoxicillin, though he had to stay for the midday drip. She also gave us a perplexing admonition not to fly for at least a week. We never did figure out what that was all about, though it seemed to have to do with gas chemistry and air pressure.

I dashed out to pay the hotel, buy train tickets, and get more Swiss money, and then we were free! We filled his prescriptions at the Pharmacie de la Gare -- the pharmacist was surprised by the need to actually charge us -- and hopped on a train.

![We said goodbye to the minotaur by the Martigny train station. He looks like he needs to pee.](images/Minotaur_IMG_8167.jpeg)

![Finally free!](images/LeavingMartigny_IMG_8213.jpeg)

Alpine Exploratory had booked all our accommodations months ahead, so we couldn't just resume where we'd left off. By this point, we were supposed to be walking from the Cabane de Moiry to Zinal, so we had to get ourselves to Zinal. But traveling in this area is a little fiddly.

The Haute Route goes up and over mountains and valleys in the most inconvenient way possible. Wheeled transportation follows the more sensible course of following the valleys. The Rhone valley is the main spine of transport, with a train line running through it east-west. The stops along the way are at the tops of the north-south valleys, which contain the towns where our route stopped for the nights. Most transportation routes therefore involved using the train to go one stop or two and then a bus for riding down to smaller towns. Only the Matterthal has its own train line between Visp and Zermatt.

From Martigny, we took a train 20 minutes east to Sierre/Siders. (Place names in the Rhone valley are generally presented in French/German pairs.) From Sierre, we took two separate buses south into the valley to Zinal. That was the scariest bit of the trip so far! The bus went up, up, up a winding mountain road that seemed to be right on the edge of a precipice at all times. I had to give Chris the window seat and keep my eyes closed so I wouldn't have to see when the bus drove right off the edge of the mountain. 

![Zinal](images/Zinal_IMG_8228.jpeg)

Zinal was all Alps and cool air, a stark contrast to sunny Martigny. We felt like honeymooners!

![Stopping for groceries. It was much cooler here!](images/Zinal_groceries_IMG_1605.JPG)

![Zinal appears to be developing rapidly, building up its ski industry. There are lots of these huge ski chalets.](images/Zinal_chalets_IMG_0006.JPG)

![Finally a nice, relaxing adult dinner!](images/Zinal_dinner_IMG_1224.JPG)

## Stage 8: Zinal to Hotel Weisshorm, Tuesday July 31

![THIS is the sort of view we came for.](images/Zinal_valley_IMG_0147.JPG)

Miracle of miracles, we were hiking again! Zinal to Hotel Weisshorn is an easy hike. It starts with a climb, but then hugs the side of the mountain range all the way. We moved slowly and took lots of breaks. We were just so happy to be walking!

![Chris had his right arm in a sling, but that just won him the admiration of fellow travelers.](images/Zinal_Chris_IMG_8273.jpeg) 

![I could finally relax!](images/Amy_relax_IMG_1538.JPG)

![We stopped to eat the snacks we'd bought in Zinal.](images/Zinal_snack_IMG_1455.JPG)

![Mountain bikers love these trails.](images/Mountain_bikes_IMG_1221.JPG)

This part of the Haute Route is somewhat flexible, route-wise. I was very taken with the idea of staying at the venerable Hotel Weisshorn, so that's the way we went.

Hotel Weisshorn is an old-school alpine hotel, reachable only on foot (most people just walk an hour from a cablecar) and with minimal amenities -- WCs in the stairwells, bathrooms in the hall. I'm certain it's haunted. But dinner is top-notch, and you can't beat the sunset from the dining room.

![Hotel Weisshorn](images/Weisshorn_IMG_8501.jpeg)

![The hallways are creepy. This place was built before anyone had en-suite bathrooms.](images/Weisshorn_hall_IMG_0023.JPG)

![Sunset](images/Weisshorn_sunset_IMG_1209.JPG)

## Stage 9: Hotel Weisshorm to Gruben, Wednesday August 1

The Haute Route is all about going up and over stuff, but dallying in Martigny had kept us off the hardest passes. Today there was no way around it. We had to cross the Meidpass, and high time!

![Chris made some new friends.](images/Meidpass_bugs_IMG_8549.jpeg)

![Even in August, there are patches of snow in the higher elevations.](images/Meidpass_snow_IMG_1181.JPG)

![The approach to the Meidpass. Look how high we've climbed!](images/Meidpass_approach_IMG_8618.jpeg)

![Almost to the pass.](images/Meidpass_gate_IMG_8646.jpeg)

![The pass itself.](images/Meidpass_IMG_8651.jpeg)

![Looking back the way we came.](images/Meidpass_back_IMG_8624.jpeg)

![The way forward.](images/Meidpass_other_side_IMG_8652.jpeg)

![Time for a snack!](images/Meidpass_snack_IMG_1378.JPG)

![Gruben lies ahead and down.](images/Gruben_descent_IMG_1373.JPG)

![A storm built up in the afternoon.](images/Gruben_storm_IMG_0935.JPG)

![Ready for rain!](images/Gruben_readyforrain_IMG_1441.JPG)

Gruben, also known as Meid, is barely a place. It's just a summer settlement. They close off the valley in the winter because it's avalanche alley. We elected to stay up the road in Oberems, in a hotel instead of a dorm bed at the [Hotel Schwarzhorn](https://www.hotelschwarzhorn.ch/de/). We took a "taxi," which was actually the postbus, Oberems not being much more of a place than Gruben. The biggest shock was having to switch from French to German.

![Hotel Schwarzhorn is right on the trail, making for a more convenient transition in the morning, but they only had dorm beds.](images/Hotel_Schwarzhorn_IMG_0324.JPG)

![Our hotel in Oberems. This might be most of the town.](images/Oberems_IMG_8775.jpeg)

We'd planned to buy snacks for the next day's hike in Oberems. But the store was closed for a national holiday, and we would have to leave the next morning before it opened. Hm.

I taught the restaurant staff how to make a kir. They also served a local liqueur made from arven pine.

![These places are so poor in plants most of the year, they'll make liquor out of ANYTHING!](images/Oberems_liqueur_IMG_8751.jpeg)

## Stage 10: Gruben to Grächen, Thursday August 2

![Chris is finally on his way to the Matterhorn!](images/HeadingSouth_IMG_0251.JPG)

Low on snacks, we stole some bits of cheese from the breakfast buffet and bought a Swiss kit kat bar from the hotel. That foraging turned out to be a wise plan. Today was a very long day in the wilderness.

This stage was too long for us. Without transport at the end, we'd probably STILL be walking up to Grächen.

Before we could even start walking, we had to take the bus from Oberems back to Gruben, where the trail passes the Hotel Schwarzhorn. That was a good half hour delay.

![The van waits for passengers to arrive from the valley (from Leuk?) on the cablecar.](images/Oberems_van_IMG_8769.jpeg)

We started with a steep climb to the Augstbordspass. Like many of the Haute Route passes, the Augstbordspass is high and far from habitation in either direction.

![Chris never failed to impress me with his good humor in the face of adversity.](images/Chris_happy_IMG_8799.jpeg)

![Cows](images/Cows_IMG_0199.JPG)

![We encountered this sign a couple of hours into the walk. In our experience, these signs are actually optimistic -- we always take longer than the posted times. Today, we had to reach St. Niklaus at the bottom of the valley and THEN make our way up the other side to Grâchen.](images/Sign_IMG_1573.JPG)

![Almost to the Augstbordspass.](images/Augstbordpass_climb_IMG_8960.jpeg)

![We made it!](images/Augstbordspass_IMG_0708.JPG)

Then we had to make a LONG descent to Jüngen. Note that the sign at the pass suggests nearly 3 hours to get there.

The last stage of this walk was downright scary - exposed and super narrow, with a steep drop off to the side. Chris did the whole thing with his mountainside arm immobilized! 

![Chris contemplates the descent.](images/Augst_descent_IMG_0970.JPG)

![The boulders take forever to navigate!](images/Boulders_IMG_0033.JPG)

![I look a bit sick here. This section was scary.](images/Scary_IMG_0356.JPG)

![But we were now into the Mattertal, the valley that ends at the Matterhorn!](images/Mattertal_IMG_1024.JPG)

We had already planned to skip the remaining walk by taking the cablecar down to St. Niklaus and then the bus back up to Grächen, a nod to our convalescent who tired easily, but we didn't even get to Jüngen until 4, so it was kind of necessary. So much for our fear that the stages would be too short!

![Jüngen](images/Jungen_IMG_1236.JPG)

The cablecar was a surprise. We expected something like the cablecars in Verbier. Um, no. This one can transport four people approximately every ten minutes. We waited an hour to ride it down (you can pay at the bottom). It was still faster than walking. The residents of Jüngen use this cablecar for their normal transportation - there seems to be no other way up or down.

![Waiting for the cablecar.](images/Cablecar_IMG_1405.JPG)

![It was a long but gorgeous ride down.](images/Cablecar_ride_IMG_1519.JPG)

I'd hoped to take advantage of our fancy hotel's spa, but we didn't arrive until 6, when the spa closed. Ah well. We had a lovely dinner nevertheless.

![Weinsuppe is a specialty.](images/Grachen_IMG_0247.JPG)

## Stage 11: Grächen to Zermatt, Friday August 3

We had always planned to do the Mattertal valley walk from St. Niklaus to Zermatt, having no desire to do the scary, rock-fallin' Europaweg. I do not love exposure, and Chris does not love rocks falling from above. Since we were starting in Grächen, though, we decided to do the mid-altitude path through Gasenreid. It was pretty and nice until it wasn't, and then we just got on the train. Sometimes that's okay. We were over trying to prove anything to anyone!

![You can take these paths pretty much anywhere.](images/Paths_IMG_0297.JPG)

![A pretty valley](images/Valley_IMG_1127.JPG)

When Chris was a kid, he read a book about climbing the Matterhorn. The thing about the Matterhorn, though, is that it is hidden behind all these other huge mountains, mostly that pesky Weisshorn, which seems to be everywhere. But we got to Zermatt, and there it was!

We walked around town some, but it was boring. We might just have no more interest in shopping and sites aimed at tourists, or maybe we were just tired.

We had dinner at a wonderful Bernese restaurant, where I got a chateaubriand and a meringue glacée that reminded me so much of Chalet Brandt in Baton Rouge.

![Meringue. What I didn't know and learned later is that meringue glacée is a classic dish of the Bernese Oberland. Also that there is a thing known as the Bernese Oberland, which we really got to know on the Via Alpina in 2022.](images/Meringue_IMG_9224.jpeg)

## Back to Paris and thence home, August 4 - 6

![We woke to the sun rising on the Matterhorn.](images/Sunrise_matterhorn_IMG_0121.JPG) 

And that was the end of our Haute Route. We took the train back to Paris that day, riding back through all the little towns we'd encountered on our way in. I felt so nostalgic when we stopped in Martigny! We got bandages and betadine at a pharmacie in Lausanne. 

In Paris, our first quest was to buy Chris a couple of long-sleeved linen shirts at Uniqlo. 

It was a good weekend. We ate at our favorite restaurants. I got an assiette of shellfish, steak tartare, and baba au rhum at [Le Vaudeville](https://www.vaudevilleparis.com/en/). Our hotel had air conditioning.

Then we went home. Chris' arm struggled to recover, but eventually did get back to normal after an injection of American antibiotics. 

And we'd had enough Alps for the moment. The next year, we hiked [coastal Brittany](https://www.sentiersdefrance.com/produit/la-cote-de-granit-rose/). There were no mountains and the seafood was wonderful!
