# Via Alpina, July 17--August 8, 2022

By Amy Hackney Blackwell

![Me and the Eiger](images/Amy_Eiger_IMG_7311.jpg)

In the summer of 2002, Chris and I [walked across Switzerland](https://schweizmobil.ch/en/hiking-in-switzerland/route-1). 

I'm not exaggerating. We started at the eastern border with Liechtenstein, and we finished in Montreux, on Lake Geneva. It took us three weeks.

![This is right about the halfway point.](images/Chris_Amy_Eiger_IMG_7458.jpg)

We hiked a route known as the [Via Alpina](https://www.alpineexploratory.com/holidays/via-alpina.html), formerly called the Alpine Pass Route.  

This trip was a long time coming. After our semi-disastrous Walkers' Haute Route experience in 2018, we'd gone off the Alps for while. We headed to coastal France instead in 2019. But after a year to recover our equilibrium, we were ready to return to Switzerland. We contacted our favorite alpine travel agency, [Alpine Exploratory](https://www.alpineexploratory.com), and booked the Via Alpina that January, along with plane tickets.

2020 didn't happen. We would've gone if we'd been allowed to, but no. We had Alpine Exploratory move our booking to the following year. (The Via Alpina season is quite short, late July to early September, so you can't just do it whenever.) The plane tickets were a loss. Oh well.

2021 didn't happen either. Once again, we would've done it if we'd been allowed to. Alpine Exploratory moved our booking one more year down the road.

By this point, hitting the Via Alpina had become something of an obsession with me. And in 2022, it finally happened. I even argued the airline into honoring the tickets we hadn't used the previous year. We were good to go.

![I even buzzed my hair before we left -- hair was one problem I didn't need to have. Looking back now, it does seem a little *Taxi Driver*. Ah well, desperate times!](images/Amy_buzzcut_IMG_7170.jpg)

## About the Via Alpina

The Via Alpina, aka the Alpine Pass Route, travels nearly due west with a slight southern tilt, crossing numerous alpine passes and staying in a series of mountain towns, ranging from the tiny Weisstannen to the chichi tourist mecca Gstaad. It's situated north of the Rhone valley, in contrast to the Walkers' Haute Route, which lies to the south of that valley. 

Switzerland being entirely mountainous, walking in any direction means a lot of up and down. Though passes, or cols, are a big part of any alpine trek, the Via Alpina has a particular emphasis on them. Nearly every day features its own pass. Passes are amazing places, where you can often see the entire route just walked along with the route yet to come. It's like looking into the past and future at once.

![Chris on the Augstbordpass between Grüben and St. Niklaus on the Haute Route. The pano exaggerates the proportions, but passes really do give this 360° vibe.](images/Augstbordspass_IMG_8657.jpg)

The nights are spent in the numerous towns that dot the mountains. Unlike some other treks that use lots of huts, the Via Alpina's accommodations are almost all in hotels with a couple of guesthouses in smaller/more remote settlements. This increases the comfort level but also increases the price -- the Via Alpina can be an expensive trip!

![Even in places like Engstlenalp, which consist of like four houses and exist solely to facilitate the tourist trade between actual towns, we stayed in actual hotels with private rooms, en suite baths, and dining facilities.](images/Hotel_Engstlenalp_IMG_7070.jpg)

Switzerland has wonderful [luggage transfer services](https://www.sbb.ch/en/tickets-offers/reservation-luggage/checking-taking-luggage/door-to-door.html). Alpine Exploratory arranged this for us, but it can be done privately as well. Every morning, we'd pack our suitcases and leave them at the front desk of our hotel. That afternoon, our bags would be awaiting us at our next destination. All we had to carry in our backpacks was water, raingear, and anything else we might want on the trail.

We were obviously traveling light -- our suitcases were carry-on size -- so we did a lot of hand laundry in hotel sinks. You really don't need that much if all you do every day is walk along mountain trails!

![A typical load-out for us: two carry-ons and two daypacks. I favor [Lipault](https://www.lipault-usa.com) suitcases for their extremely light weight.](images/Luggage_IMG_6476.JPG)

A lot of the places we stayed and things we did on the Via Alpina are probably well known to Brits, Germans, and other people who customarily vacation in the Alps, just like people in South Carolina know what you can do in Myrtle Beach or Isle of Palms. While everything seemed new and strange to us, the places we stayed are old standard tourist establishments, some of which have been around since the late 1800s. Towns with odd names are ski resorts now -- you can probably buy package tours to fly you from Birmingham (the one in the UK, not Alabama).

The temptation is to believe that we've made new discoveries, but nothing could be further from the truth. Anytime you find something new in Switzerland, it's because you're a novice and don't know anything. This place has been around for a very long time.


### Distance and transportation options

The stages on the Via Alpina tend to be long, many of them well over 20 kilometers. 24 kilometers in a single day is a lot, especially if you're still adjusting to the time difference. 29 kilometers is probably beyond our capabilities.

We have concluded that 18 kilometers in a day is about as far as we can walk and remain happy. As this trek wore on, we grew increasingly adept at modifying our routes for our own purposes, which included maintaining realistic distances. 

Modifications are generally easy to do because there are tons of public transportation options and lots and lots of alternate trails. It can be smart to at least look at a map before taking a trail, but everything is extremely well marked, and it's almost always possible to navigate just by following signs.

![Pick your own route!](images/Sign_IMG_6821.jpg)

![The Via Alpina's white and red blaze.](images/Blaze_IMG_6859.jpg)

Our route cards from Alpine Exploratory often suggested variants for a day's walk, but we did some of our own as well. Some alternate trails were great (the Eiger trail was gloriously unforgettable) and some not so great (the terrifying balcony walk into Meiringen and the even more terrifying steep climb out of Mürren - if Alpine Exploratory calls something "unreasonably steep," it's best to listen.) 

Buses, trains, and -- best of all -- cablecars are everywhere. They are expensive, to be sure, but they're ubiquitous and easy to use. The ski lifts run all summer, the better to maximize tourist francs, and they are a godsend for trimming ascents and descents. The Swiss transit app is super easy to use, making transport really painless.

![One of many Swiss trains. Chris had a toy one when he was 2 years old and living in Cold War Berlin. Brings back dim memories.](images/Train_IMG_6581.jpg)


## Difficulty

This goes along with distance, but the fact is, some passes are harder than others!

Some of them are gentle and grassy. Others are steep, include trails along the edges of cliffs, and require long periods of walking through the sharp scree that is the result of big mountains slowly turning into small mountains.

I am reasonably afraid of heights, or rather of "exposure". 

> "Exposure" here does not mean "getting cold and wet and hypothermic", but the psychological effect of being high up and seeing clearly how steep is the drop below you. A trail high on a cliff-side might be no problem in a dense fog, but when the fog lifts and you see the valley far below, down a steep drop, it is terrifying. That's "exposure" in this sense.

Edges are especially scary, but a big expanse of sky on one side of a steep slope will do it too. I found a lot of these trails disagreeably scary. I'm not the only one -- we encountered other American tourists who had the wits scared out of them by passes.

![Chris descending the scree slope on the west side of the Sefinenfurgga.](images/Scree_descent_Serina_IMG_7898.mov)

People develop strategies for handling these situations. Mine include muttering mantras to myself like a lunatic, using all four limbs like Gollum, and using Chris as a coach. For example, I might say "Tell me to stand up and walk across this rock." He will say "Stand up and walk across that rock." And I will do it because I believe the words when they come out of his mouth but I don't listen to myself.

![Oh, lordy! But the only way off that scary ridge is down, so down I went. Slowly.](images/Descent_IMG_7878.jpg)

Aside from scariness, the Via Alpina involves a LOT of climbing. And, inevitably, a lot of descent. Though most Swiss trails are beautifully maintained and easy to walk (for example, compared to trails in South Carolina, which can be rocky and uneven), climbing is inherently hard.

![Up, up, up we go. See the peak in the background? We're going up that.](images/Climb_IMG_7700.MOV)

Scariness and general climbiness were factors we considered when choosing modifications. We try not to eliminate too many challenges, but we're old enough to be realistic and we don't feel like we have to prove anything. We were purists for the Tour du Mont Blanc in 2018, walking (almost) every step of the way. For this trip, purity was out the window. It was hard enough just to get through without forcing ourselves into unreasonable difficulties. If a cablecar could save us two or three hours of walking at a time when we felt like that would be pleasant -- well, we took the damn cablecar!


### Shoes

It's been many years since either of us has worn hiking boots. We've used Altra trail runners for all our Alpine hikes as well as hiking over Greece and in the Nepali Himalayas. 

![Amy wore Altra Superiors, the lightest trail shoes Altra offers.](images/Altra_Superior_IMG_6651.jpeg)

> On one of the final days of our Everest Base Camp trek, we passed a group going north, clumping along in their huge boots. Someone saw us and exclaimed "Trainers for trekking?" We said nothing, but inwardly were, like, "We've just done this whole trek, Yo!"

![Chris has always favored the Lone Peaks.](images/LonePeak_IMG_6950.jpg)

We never get blisters. Our feet never hurt. 

I always wear lightweight toe socks. 

I also carried a pair of Bedrock Cairns as my in-town shoes. They could double as trail shoes in a pinch, though I really don't love them on rough or rocky terrain. (Some people do walk long trail distances in them, though.)

![My saffron-yellow Bedrocks, which never cease to delight me!](images/Bedrock_IMG_7299.jpg)

### Bernese Oberland

The [Bernese Oberland](https://www.berneseoberlandpass.ch/en/?gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=17142109809&gbraid=0AAAAADKUlizGW0jXJnZs1v2_pJJz2ZM7e&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIiKGDwZucjwMVOHV_AB1xuAi3EAAYASAAEgKEXvD_BwE), or Bernese highland, is a key feature of the Via Alpina. The entire middle week is set there, and lots of people just walk that section. 

It really is the money shot of the Swiss Alps. Though all the mountains there are eye-catching because the are SO VERY BIG, three peaks in particular stand out:

- The Eiger, or the Ogre.
- The Mönch, or the Monk.
- The Jungfrau, or the Maiden.

The area around these three peaks is called the Jungfrau region. 

![The Eiger, looming over Grindelwald's valley.](images/Eiger_IMG_7329.jpg)

![A view of the Eiger from the other side, with the Mönch to my right.](images/Eiger_IMG_7549.jpg)

![Here's the Mönch.](images/Monch_IMG_7555.jpg)

![The Jüngfrau looks over Wengen.](images/Jungfrau_IMG_7619.jpg)

![The big three lined up on our way to Mürren.](images/Bigthree_IMG_7645.jpg)

The [Jungfrau Railway](https://www.jungfrau.ch/en-gb/?srsltid=AfmBOorLnWxF9Ftswe1Tflb0qGAQETajrYWFb23A7gG4Fno2h2_ABLlJ), or Jungfraubahn, runs tourists right up to the [Jungfraujoch](https://wengen.swiss/en/services/operating-status/mountain-railways.html), the highest railway station in the world (3,454 meters!). It's built up with tourist amenitices, of course, including a high "cliff walk," but it does provide amazing views across the Swiss plateau and the Aletsch Glacier.

Grindelwald, Wengen, and Mürren are the three classic resort towns of the Bernese Oberland. [Grindelwald](https://www.myswitzerland.com/en-us/destinations/grindelwald/?_gl=1*2juuh6*_up*MQ..*_ga*MTQ3NzIwMzE5NS4xNzU1NjEwMzU3*_ga_F6N1LVHY7B*czE3NTU2MTAzNTYkbzEkZzAkdDE3NTU2MTAzNTYkajYwJGwwJGgxODI5MTg3MzMz) lies under the Eiger. [Wengen](https://www.myswitzerland.com/en-us/destinations/wengen/) is down the valley from the Junfrau, and well known for the [Lauberhorn ski race](https://www.myswitzerland.com/en-us/experiences/the-lauberhorn-run/?_gl=1*1fm7tfl*_up*MQ..*_ga*MTQ3NzIwMzE5NS4xNzU1NjEwMzU3*_ga_F6N1LVHY7B*czE3NTU2MTAzNTYkbzEkZzAkdDE3NTU2MTAzNTYkajYwJGwwJGgxODI5MTg3MzMz). [Mürren](https://www.myswitzerland.com/en-us/destinations/muerren/) is a car-free town across a narrow valley from all three peaks, with especially good views of the Jungfrau.

Most Americans don't realize (well, we didn't before we started traveling here) is that Europeans have been doing tourism in the Alps for several centuries now. These three resorts, along with places Zermatt, Verbier, and Chamonix in France pop up in British and German travel feeds on a daily basis. It always struck me how places that felt strange and unknown to us were in fact extremely well-established tourist locations, just like shared nude bathing facilities are in fact a completely ordinary feature of the hotels.

Anyway! The Bernese Oberland resorts are cute, especially car-free Mürren, but they're also very touristic. They give off a very different vibe from the tiny, isolated towns we stayed in on either side of the region. And they're expensive -- oh, so expensive!

That being said, the mountains are well worth seeing, and the whole area is criss-crossed with cog railroads, gondolas, and bus routes, making it very easy for tourists of all levels of fitness to visit comfortably. Anyone looking for a quick Swiss vacation really should head to this area at least once. There's nothing else like it.

As for us, our Via Alpina started and finished small and quiet. In general, that's the way we prefer things.


## Sunday, July 17: Sargans

This trip started on Saturday morning, when our son drove us to Charlotte for a 1:00 flight to Philadelphia. Ideally we like to fly direct from CLT to Munich, but by going to Philly, we could fly straight to Zurich. We had to take a train on one end of our trip, and it was shorter to ride from Montreux to Zurich on the back end than from Munich to Sargans on the front.

In any case, travel was easy, though Philadelphia's airport has become unlivably crowded with restaurants occupying the former gate areas. I got some real work done in the AA lounge, though.

The flight to Zurich was only about half full, and premium economy was comfortable. Arrival in Zurich was great, too -- super quick immigration, and we'd carried our bags with us so we could just leave.

We headed straight to the trains, where we took a quick ride to the Hauptbahnhof and then a train straight to Sargans, where the Via Alpina began. (They've subsequently added a [new first stage](https://schweizmobil.ch/en/hiking-in-switzerland/route-1/stage-1) that begins in Vaduz, Liechtenstein.) We were in town by 1 pm, only slightly stunned by jet lag. 

Sargans was hot and sunny and fairly dead on a Sunday afternoon. Our hotel was actually in Mels, another "town" though it seems contiguous with Sargans. We dragged our suitcases about a mile down the road to get there.

![Mels was even deader than Sargans. We ended up getting lunch at a kebab place, which are always reliable.](images/Mels_IMG_6479.jpg)

After a nap in our hot bedroom, we walked into Sargans hoping for a cooler evening. 

![We had a glass of wine at the town castle.](images/Sargans_castle_IMG_6480.jpg)

![The castle looks into neighboring Liechtenstein. The Via Alpina now starts in Zaduz, Liechtenstein.](images/Sargans_IMG_6481.jpg)

![You can buy Swiss tourist stuff here.](images/Sargans_cowbell_IMG_6482.jpg)

After wandering the town looking for a "typische" restaurant that wasn't either crammed full or sitting next to a ridiculously loud road, we ended up at an Asian place, where we were served a lovely meal by a young woman carrying her new baby in a snuggli. I left my LSU baseball cap there -- I hope some young man is wearing it!

It was so good to sleep. 

## Monday July 18: Sargans to Weisstannen

[Sargans to Weisstannen](https://schweizmobil.ch/en/hiking-in-switzerland/route-1/stage-2)

![And we're off!](images/Sargans_on_our_way_IMG_6484.jpeg)

It was good to sleep, but it did seem that church bells rang every hour. We slept with the windows open, of course, as one does in un-airconditioned Switzerland. 

This morning we got into our usual routine: breakfast at the hotel, pack up our suitcases, and head on out. We stopped at the local Coop grocery store for snacks before hitting the trail. 

Today was a short and easy walk. Weisstannen is so close to Mels it's hardly a stage, but Elm is much too far to do in one go. And the buses don't really seem to operate much, so taking a bus to Weisstannnen to start the walk isn't realistic. No matter, it's nice to start with something easy.

![Self-service schnapps in the forest.](images/Sargans_Alpenzeller_IMG_6490.jpeg)

![A funny sign](images/Sargans_funny_sign_IMG_6487.jpeg)

The Sargans area is famous for being the region where *Heidi* is set. People come from all over to visit [Heididorf](https://www.heididorf.ch/en/welcome/heidis-village/), [Heidiland](https://heidiland.com/en/region/all-about-heidi.html) and the town of [Maienfeld](https://www.myswitzerland.com/en-us/experiences/maienfeld-heidis-world/), the village below Grandfather's hut. This region is apparently popular with Japanese visitors. 

![We stopped to fill our water blivets at a fountain.](images/Sargans_fountain_IMG_6505.jpeg)

We were in Weisstannen by noon. We ate lunch on the terrace of [Hotel Gemse](https://www.weisstannen.ch), where we were staying. It's now possible to order a "Fitnessteller," or diet plate, which comes with salad instead of the ubiquitous fries. 

![I got a Fitnessteller mit Schnitzel natur, or non-deep-fried schnitzel.](images/Fitnessteller_IMG_6506.jpeg) 

After lunch, we lay down to try to nap. This proved impossible due to the FLIES. Switzerland in summer is nothing but flies, and in a land without air conditioning, in which the windows are wide open to the breeze, there is no keeping the insects out. The good news is that flies go to bed at sunset. The bad news is that the rise with the sun, and love nothing better than to alight on a sleeper's mouth and nose.

To say that Weisstannen is small is an understatement.

![There are lots of gardens here.](images/Weisstannen_garden_IMG_6508.jpeg)

![Weisstannen school garden](images/Weisstannen_schoolgarden_IMG_6513.jpeg)

![Flies notwithstanding, we're just happy to finally be on our way!](images/Weisstannen_started_IMG_6518.jpg)

## Tuesday July 19: Weisstannen to Elm 

[Weisstannen to Elm](https://schweizmobil.ch/en/hiking-in-switzerland/route-1/stage-3)

![We're heading this way.](images/Weisstannen_leaving_IMG_6520.jpg)

We were up early this morning to get a good start on our first long day.  Today would cross our first pass, the broad and grassy [Foopass](https://schweizmobil.ch/en/hiking-in-switzerland/route-1/stage-3). Our destination, Elm, was a full 24 kilometers from Weisstannen, none of which we could eliminate with public transport.

![We stopped at a farm/café for coffee. They had pigs.](images/Wesistannen_pigs_IMG_6526.jpg)

![Then we headed up the valley in the direction of the Foopass.](images/Foopass_valley_IMG_6536.jpg)

Just before the pass, we stopped at a high farm on the Fooalp for a snack. 

![The farm appeared unmanned except for some cows, but it sold drinks in a self-service box, entirely on the honor system.](images/Foopass_cows_IMG_6543.jpg)

![I'd bought some picnic Eier, or hard-boiled eggs in Sargans the day before. They were bio, or organic, as are most produce products these days. These became a staple of our Via Alpina diet.](images/Foopass_snack_IMG_6547.jpg)

The Foopass isn't the highest or hardest pass by any means, but it still provided plenty of challenge, especially on our second day on the trail.

![Chris keeps on climbing!](images/Foopass_climb_IMG_6551.jpg)

![The Foopass!](images/Foopass_IMG_6566.jpg)

![Looking back toward Weisstannen.](images/Foopass_backtoWeisstannen_IMG_6562.jpg)

![Looking forward toward Elm and tomorrow's pass, the Richetlipass.](images/Foopass_forwardtoElm_IMG_6568.jpg)

Chris's metabolism hadn't caught up with the time of day -- his body thought it should still be in bed -- and he was literally raining sweat as we climbed. He drank all his water on the ascent. This part of the trail was a good place to run out of water, though. The hill on the downhill side of the Foopass was full of mountain springs pouring forth the purest, coolest water. It was like the elixir of Lothlorien! 

![Fortunately, I'd just bought a Coke from those cows, so I had a bottle with which to collect this spring water.](images/Elm_cokebottle_IMG_6573.jpg)

Just because a path leads gently downhill doesn't mean it's short or easy! We were feeling quite tired by the time we knocked off the last few kilometers and strolled into Elm around 5:30.

![Elm, finally! Elm is the origin of the name "Elmer."](images/Elm_IMG_6580.jpg)

![Elm is famous for this hole in the mountains. It's called Martin's Hole, and twice a year the sun shines right through it onto the church.](images/Elm_Martins_hole_IMG_6585.jpg)


## Wednesday July 20: Elm to Braunwald

[Elm to Braunwald](https://schweizmobil.ch/en/hiking-in-switzerland/route-1/stage-4)

And it was another beautiful morning!

![Elm in the morning, including the mineral water bottling plant.](images/Elm_morning_IMG_6586.jpg)

![Our hotel, [Gasthaus Segnes](https://segnes.ch/de/)](images/Elm_hotel_IMG_6608.jpg)

After yesterday's epic physical challenge, we didn't relish the thought of an even longer walk over a harder pass, the Richetlipass. With rain in the forecast, we didn't love the prospect of a descent on steep, loose scree. In addition, the 24.4 kilometers of the route would only get us to Linthal, and we were staying on up the hill in Braunwald. In the interest of not killing ourselves, we decided to make the day easier.

The previous evening, a fellow traveler told us about the Swiss travel app that could be used to ride any sort of public transportation. We loaded this app onto our phones, and it transformed our Via Alpina experience! It works VERY well, tracking travel by the second and making it simple to find routes and get to destinations the most expeditious way possible. To begin with, it showed us how to get ourselves to Braunwald in a couple of hours.

Having let ourselves off that particular hook, we could now do a leisurely morning walk that covered some but not all of the prescribed route. We walked through town to a cablecar that whisked us up to a settlement called Ämpächli. There, we picked up a balcony trail that we walked to Obererbs.

![This was a beautiful walk and a good loosener after yesterday.](images/Elm_trail_IMG_6593.jpg)

![There were some old huts up there.](images/Elm_trail_huts_IMG_6588.jpg)

![Looking up the valley back to Elm.](images/Elm_lookback_IMG_6598.jpg)

At Obererbs, there is a ski hut that makes a nice break for people who do walk this entire stage. The trail from here leads up to the Wichlenmatt and the Richetlipass and thence to Linthal.  

Instead of visiting the ski hut, we just caught a bus back to Elm. After that, it was a simple matter to catch another bus to Schwanden and a train to Linthal. The Linthal train conductors shuttled most us straight to the turnstyles to the funicular that runs up to Braunwald.

Braunwald is a car-free town up on a shelf above Linthal. It's a major tourist destination. 

The funicular got us up the hill, but we still had a long, stiff climb to the [Hotel Tödiblick](https://www.hotel-toediblick.ch).

![The hotel will send a horse-drawn carriage to collect guests who have the foresight to call ahead.](images/Braunwald_horse_IMG_6610.MOV) 

![We had a bottle of Elmer water with dinner.](images/Braunwald_water_IMG_6615.jpg)

We dined on the terrace with a beautiful view of the mountains we'd come from that day. There was a thunderstorm after dinner. That was dramatic, and it also helped settle the damn flies.

![Before it got completely dark, we got a glimpse up the valley we'd be walking the next day.](images/Braunwald_clouds_IMG_6626.jpg)


## Thursday July 21: Braunwald to Klausenpass

[Braunwald to Klausenpass](https://schweizmobil.ch/en/hiking-in-switzerland/route-1/stage-5)

It was cloudy all day. 

![Looking up to Braunwald as we walked out.](images/Braunwald_clouds_IMG_6637.jpg)

Today's walk from Linthal to the Klausenpass was supposed to be another 24 kilometers, but we'd shortened it by staying in Braunwald.

![And away we go!](images/Chris_Braunwald_IMG_6640.jpg)

![In the early morning, most of the forests were completely socked in with fog.](images/Braunwald_fog_IMG_6645.jpg)

Much of this walk was relatively easy, through cool damp forest and then along the valley of Uri to the town of Urnerboden. We stopped at the Hotel Sonne for Gulashsuppe and Gershensuppe (barley soup).

![At one point the trail unbelievably led through a working gravel factory.](images/Quarry_IMG_6662.MOV)

![The town of Urner Boden lies in the flat valley.](images/UrnerBoden_IMG_6670.jpg)

The challenge started in the afternoon, when we began to climb up to the Klausenpass. This climb wasn't so bad! 

![There were cows everywhere, including on the trail.](images/Klausenpass_cows_IMG_6689.jpg)

![Sports car owners like to come to Uri to [drive their cars up and down the winding mountain roads here](https://www.epikdrives.com/best-drives/klausen-pass).](images/Klausenpass_road_IMG_6684.jpg) 

We got to the Klausenpass by 3. 

![We stopped at the little roadside café for a snack of Schnitzelbrot. This place is very popular with the motorcyclists and sportcar drivers who frequent this route.](images/Klausenpass_restaurant_IMG_6718.jpg)

![Postbuses travel everywhere in Switzerland. The drivers seem unphased by navigating these serpentines. I guess they do it every day.](images/Klausenpass_bus_IMG_6707.mov)

Then it was a short walk on to our accommodation. Alpine Exploratory had luckily gotten us a room at the Hotel Klausenpass, a hotel situated right on the pass. Often hikers must catch a bus down to Altdorf to spend the night and take the bus back to resume the hike the next morning, so it was a treat to be able to stay on the pass itself.

![We had a good steak for dinner, followed by this meringue, which looks like a marine arthropod from the Carboniferous period.](images/Klausenpass_meringue_IMG_6724.jpg)


## Friday July 22: Klausenpass to Altdorf 

[Klausenpass to Altdorf](https://schweizmobil.ch/en/hiking-in-switzerland/route-1/stage-6)

We awoke to a perfect sunny day!

![A sunny morning looking in the direction of Altdorf, our next stop.](images/Klausenpass_morning_IMG_6738.jpg)

That night, I'd received an email from the For Dummies people, inquiring whether we wanted to revise and republish [*Mythology for Dummies*](https://www.amazon.com/Mythology-Dummies-Amy-Hackney-Blackwell/dp/1394187939/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1BQUJJ2ZORY0P&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.FS4zHfZ5JS795dHILYI8NuD-DduU4-1wpF4zeLr17DzESRWJTNM5gdH2_avIlp3Vlddk2-g-mrb5DPdgnxR_sTjzMZOvavNDjvNAH6FIka3GEh3yjpEPRT48XmWf8dR9FR5j4AauF-GaTulsEkpmyp-DYqGZoL9kpiwL4iA9hgagbfRboQGq44MijbexXHWeCHFIb9aKmpJHWFXhOa8y0GAHJvLJJxCtaX-xN6CmXKk.kzFn9_WETlMIPKOwWAwjY6SOvlC8aigoNlBT-6Ea0Ok&dib_tag=se&keywords=mythology+for+dummies&qid=1755703348&sprefix=mythology+for+dummies%2Caps%2C164&sr=8-1). We couldn't quite believe it had been 20 years since we'd first published that one! Revision seemed like quite a good idea; probably we'd learned some stuff since 2001.

Today was mainly a valley walk but it was not without its challenges. We had to begin by descending a cliffside to get down to the valley. The trail was so loose and steep, it took us two hours to reach the bottom. 

![At least we didn't have to walk UP.](images/Klausenpass_steep_IMG_6759.jpg)

![Then it was an easy walk through the long valley through Uri or Untersächsen.](images/Altdorf_valley_IMG_6781.jpg) 

We stopped in a little town for coffee. It seemed too early for lunch; we thought we'd get food in the next town. Alas, the rest of the villages were closed, or not yet open for the summer. This is a hazard of "off-season" travel; places can be seriously dead.

![This is where all that cheese comes from.](images/Altdorf_cows_IMG_6770.jpg)

![Could this be more bucolic!](images/Altdorf_bucolic_IMG_6776.jpg)

It was well into the afternoon when we finally found an café less than an hour from Altdorf. We ordered something called "chili cheese bowls," which turned out to be fried balls of cheese and peppers. (From the frozen food section....)

![I tried a local soft drink called Zämå, which we'd seen for sale in other places. It was delicious, very light and herbal, and I quickly decided it would be my drink of choice thereafter. Sadly, I never saw it again!](images/Altdorf_zama_IMG_6786.jpg)

![Altdorf is famous as the hometown of Swiss hero William Tell, who had great confidence in his skill with a crossbow.](images/Altdorf_WmTell_IMG_6790.jpg)

We arrived in Altdorf and moved into [Hotel Höfli](https://www.hotel-hoefli.ch/en/) with a couple of hours to spare before dinnertime. I got some work done; I had no intention or time to do substantive work on this trip, but I could at least review designs for my case brief videos.

![We dined in the hotel's garden. A thunderstorm descended during the meal.](images/Altdorf_rain_IMG_6799.MOV)

![I had Kalbsleber mit Rösti. Liver is a great source of iron, important for building respiratory capacity to handle higher altitude!](images/Altdorf_liver_IMG_6801.jpg)


## Saturday July 23: Altdorf to Engelberg

[Altdorf to Engelberg](https://schweizmobil.ch/en/hiking-in-switzerland/route-1/stage-7)

This was a super-long hike! The official route is 29 (30?) kilometers, up and over a serious pass, the Surenenpass. We know ourselves, and we knew that 29 (or 30) kilometers was much too far for us to cover in one day. Even with transport on either end, we only made it to town an hour or two before dinnertime.

Alpine Exploratory notes that "The first ascent can be shortened by a cable car to Brusti, saving 1,080 m and 3.5 km." We definitely wanted to do this shortening! But I was worried about the little car, and how long it might take us to catch it, and whether it would even be manned. We'd been burned on the Walkers' Haute Route when we counted on taking a cablecar down from Jungen to St. Niklaus. This cablecar turned out to hold four people at a time and ran on a ten-minute cycle; we waited over an hour to get our turn to ride it. 

![Waiting for a cab at Hotel Höfli in Altdorf](images/Altdorf_hotel_IMG_6804.jpg)

To maximize our chances of this cablecar working out and transporting us right away, we took a cab from the hotel to the Brusti cablecar middle station. It turned out to be easy; a bunch of people were heading up, including a local teenager who seemed to be visiting her aunt and uncle up on the mountain and a package traveling on its own.

![A tiny cablecar, but not as tiny as some.](images/Brusti_cablecar_IMG_6807.jpg)

![Check out the address on the package.](images/Brusti_package_IMG_6810.jpg)

![The gravitational assist let us start walking here, far above Altdorf.](images/Surenenpass_start_IMG_6816.jpg)

There was plenty of climbing at the top! The Surenenpass has a rocky approach but opens into a glorious view down two valleys. 

![We stopped for coffee at a little farm on the way up. Check out their truck!](images/Surenenpass_coffee_IMG_6823.jpg) 

Then we walked! The approach to this pass was particularly beautiful and relatively easy until we were right under it.

![A gorgeous and evocative approach to a pass!](images/Surenenpass_trail_IMG_6836.jpg)

![We could see ibexes traversing the rocky face.](images/Surenenpass_ibex_rocks_IMG_6867.jpg)

We arrived at the pass around noon.

![Surenenpass. Note the mountain bike arriving at the top so he can catapult himself down the other side.](images/Surenenpass_IMG_6889.jpg)

![Looking back the way we came; Altdorf long ago stopped being visible.](images/Surenenpass_lookingback_IMG_6880.jpg)

![And looking forward. I think the peak in the distance is Titlis.](images/Surenenpass_forward_IMG_6891.jpg)

Then there was still a LOOOOONG walk down the valley to Engelberg. So we got going! At least it was downhill.

![The poor cows were absolutely encased in flies.](images/Surenenpass_cows_IMG_6900.jpg)

![There was another self-service concession stand at a farm.](images/Surenenpass_farm_IMG_6907.jpg)

The rain started in the middle of the afternoon. It poured down on us as we picked our way through the muddy forest trail.

![It's raining and town is still nowhere in sight!](images/Engleberg_long_way_away_IMG_6915.jpg)

We'd cut about 4 kilometers off the total distance that morning, but that still left around 25 to go. Engelberg still seemed very far away when we arrived at the bus stop at the end of the road leading toward the ski areas. With the rain continuing, a bus into town seemed like a very good idea!

![Engelberg looks like every other Swiss mountain town.](images/Engelberg_IMG_6921.jpg)

Having been whisked the last 5 kilometers into town, we made our way to the [Hotel Alpenclub](https://www.alpenclub.ch/hotel/arrangements/lazydays?gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=19978644644&gbraid=0AAAAACvBjgWEgsbvPRm8A__OstssgvU50&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIvOL6xcCPjwMVC1B_AB0cHjvHEAAYASAAEgL73vD_BwE), where we'd spend the next two nights. Tomorrow was a rest day!

![The back of the Alpenclub, including our window through which our pet fly could enter.](images/Engelberg_hotel_IMG_6923.jpg)

## Sunday July 24: Rest day in Engelberg

Our rest day began with the ubiquitous church bells and the flies that arose at dawn landing on our mouths in bed. We were getting used to these things, and managed to lie abed a little longer.

It was another beautiful morning. We took a leisurely stroll through town, which was pleasantly cooler than South Carolina. 

![The town on a sunny morning.](images/Engelberg_morning_IMG_6924.jpg)

![I bought a blue On baseball cap to replace my LSU digicamo cap that I'd left behind in Sargans.](images/Titlis_hat_IMG_7301.jpg)

![The ubiquitous milky mountain stream runs alongside town.](images/Engelberg_stream_IMG_6926.jpg)

Engelberg is dominated by a peak (and commercial establishment) called [Titlis](https://www.titlis.ch/en/information). Seeking a view, we took a cablecar all the way up to the summit. You have to change cars near the top, switching from an ordinary gondola to the giant panorama cars. 

![These modern cablecars can carry bicycles. They move really slowly through stations, allowing easy exits and boarding, and then speed way up to ascend and descend.](images/Engelberg_ski_lift_IMG_6928.mov)

![We passed over the Trübsee.](images/Trubsee_IMG_6931.jpg)

The summit is well-developed, with shops (wanna buy a Tissot?) and restaurants and other tourist amenities. The place was mobbed with visitors, but we still got a great view of the surrounding mountains. We could see the Eiger and the Jungfrau off in the distance; we'd be heading into the Bernese Oberland next.

![An amazing view of mountains.](images/Titlis_mountains_IMG_6946.jpg)

![The terrace up top.](images/Titlis_terrace_IMG_6951.jpg)

![There's still snow on the path leading to the [Titlis Cliff Walk](https://www.titlis.ch/en/activities/titlis-cliff-walk).](images/Bedrocks_IMG_7297.jpeg)

![The top of the Bernese Oberland, where we would head next. We took the time to identify what we were pretty sure were the Eiger, Mönch, and Jungfrau.](images/titlis_Oberland_IMG_6941.jpg)

![Looking toward our future.](images/Titlis_future_IMG_7303.jpg)

![Waiting for the panorama car to return to take us back down.](images/Titlis_panorama_IMG_6955.jpg)

![A view of a melting glacier.](images/Titlis_glacier_IMG_6960.jpg)

![We rode back down to the Trübsee stop, where we had a drink on a sunny terrace before heading back to town.](images/Trubsee_IMG_6965.jpg)

That afternoon, as Eiger prep, we watched the film [Nordwand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Face_(film)), a German movie about a tragically failed attempt to climb the north face of the Eiger in 1936. 

Our room at the Alpenclub had an odd bathroom arrangment. The WC was on one side of the room, and the shower on the other. The shower had a glass door, which made it less than private.

Rest days are wonderful!

![Another Fitnessteller with steak.](images/Engelberg_dinner_IMG_6975.jpg)


## Monday July 25: Engelberg to Engstlenalp

[Engelberg to Engstlenalp](https://schweizmobil.ch/en/hiking-in-switzerland/route-1/stage-8)

The damn fly woke us up as usual. It was all right, though, because we had to move on!

Breakfast in this hotel was slow. Instead of setting up the usual breakfast buffet, they had a waiter who took all orders and served everything in person, which for some reason took a very long time.

We could've started today's hike by taking one of the cablecars we'd ridden yesterday up to the Trübsee lake, or even all the way to the Jochpass itself. But that wouldn't have left much of a walk for us to do. So we started walking right on up!

![Leaving Engelberg](images/Engelberg_leaving_IMG_6985.jpg)

![Cows everywhere, as always](images/Engelberg_cows_IMG_6980.MOV)

![Looking back, with the cablecar above -- and we're not on it!](images/Engelberg_under_cablecar_IMG_6991.jpg)

It took a couple of hours for us to climb up to the Trübsee. We stopped for drinks on the same sunny terrace as the day before. 

![The Trübsee is a big tourist attraction. They have donkeys for kids to ride.](images/Trubsee_donkeys_IMG_7002.jpg)

![The snack bar and terrace can accommodate large numbers of guests. The restaurant is astonishingly elegant, no comparison with ski snack bars in the U.S., or at least in the Carolinas. You want champagne and fondue? They got that!](images/Trubsee_snackbar_IMG_7006.jpg)

![And now -- you go up!](images/Jochpass_up_IMG_7007.jpg)

The climb up to the pass probably took another two hours. It was uphill all the way!

![Along the way, we were repeatedly passed by skinny dudes RUNNING the entire Via Alpina. This is an annual marathon. They were much with us today and the next day, and then we never saw them again.](images/Engelberg_runners_IMG_7022.jpg)

![Chris and I were NOT running uphill.](images/Jochpass_chris_IMG_7015.jpg)

![We had a great view of Titlis and the summit structure we'd visited the day before.](images/Jochpass_titlis_IMG_7032.jpg)

![Almost to the Jochpass!](images/Jochpass_IMG_7039.MOV)

![Cows at the Jochpass](images/Jochpass_cows_IMG_7045.jpg)

![We had burgers on the terrace of the Jochpass restaurant. Some Swiss air force F-16s flew over, but they've got nothing on our Blue Angels.](images/Jochpass_burger_IMG_7054.jpg)

Here, we had another opportunity to take a cablecar part of the way down, but we virtuously skipped it and walked all the way down to Engslenalp.

![The way down](images/Jochpass_down_IMG_7056.jpg)

[Engstlenalp](https://alpinehikers.com/engstlenalp-a-perfect-day-out-between-bern-and-central-switzerland-2/) isn't really a town, more just a place where tourists stop. Alpine Exploratory often puts people in Meiringen for this night if [Hotel Engstlenalp](https://www.engstlenalp.ch/en/) happens to be full.

![The lake by Engslenalp.](images/Engslenalp_lake_IMG_7062.jpg)

![It's a bucolic country setting, perfect for restoring the souls of urbanites.](images/Engslenalp_bucolic_IMG_7066.jpg)

![The auberge drying its saffron-colored sheets in the sunshine.](images/Engstlenalp_sheets_drying_IMG_7069.jpg)

![The auberge at Engslenalp](images/Engstlenalp_auberge_IMG_7070.jpg)

![Our room. This is the customary bedding practice in Switzerland and Germany - a flat sheet and then just a single down duvet in a cover on top, no top sheet or other blankets.](images/Engslenalp_room_IMG_7071.jpg)

We had an aperitif on the lovely terrace and half-board dinner. We were too tired to stay up late. It turned out one rest day wasn't enough to prevent fatigue today. We went to bed early.


## Tuesday July 26: Engstlenalp to Meiringen

[Engstlenalp to Meiringen](https://schweizmobil.ch/en/hiking-in-switzerland/route-1/stage-9)

Today was supposed to be one of the most glorious stages of the whole Via Alpina, a ridge walk with views ahead to the main event Bernese Oberland. Alas, we awoke to full cloud coverage and a determined drizzle. There was absolutely nothing to see.

![The view? You can barely see Hotel Engstlenalp over Chris' shoulder.](images/Engstlenalp_leaving_IMG_7078.jpg)

Given the invisibility of the [Planplatten ridge](https://www.komoot.com/highlight/495003), we decided to take the valley route instead, mainly for safety. The marathon runners all had to head up to the ridge; that was the last time we saw most of them, their finish time being notably faster than ours.

![It was a pretty valley walk, anyway.](images/Engstlenalp_valley_IMG_7090.jpg)

![The clouds make it look mysterious.](images/Engstlenalp_valley_IMG_7095.jpg)

![There are tons of waterfalls in the Alps.](images/Engstlenalp_waterfall_IMG_7093.mov)

![Dairy farmers use these mini-cablecars to move milk down the mountain.](images/Engstlenalp_milk_cablecar_IMG_7096.jpg)

![Some of the walk was on the road. The morning was uncharacteristically flat.](images/Engstlenalp_road_IMG_7100.jpg)

The weather cleared shortly after noon, and it got hot.

![The sun is coming out! There are still clouds above, though.](images/Engstlenalp_sunny_IMG_7112.jpg)

The day's walking was easy except for a two-hour section we brought on ourselves. Instead of following our route cards, we chose to follow signs pointing to Meiringen. As it happened, the trail we followed is an apparently little-used balcony trail that went around the rocky mountainside about 1000 feet above the valley. It was narrow, slippery, and full of rocks and roots placed there to trip us. That was a real disappointment after skipping our glorious ridge walk, which had the added advantage of cable cars at the end to facilitate the descent into town.

![After it got hot, I regretted wearing leggings. This was the only day I didn't wear shorts.](images/Meiringen_arrival_IMG_7401.jpg)

Meiringen seemed nice enough, what we saw of it. All the servers at our restaurant were either Portuguese or Croatian; they didn't really speak German.

After the fact, I read more about the [Planplatten hike](https://alpshiking.swisshikingvacations.com/best-of-the-via-alpina-engstlenalp-to-planplatten/), and decided that it's something I'd really like to do if the opportunity ever comes my way. On a clear day, there's nothing like high alpine scenery.


## Wednesday July 27: Meiringen to Gindelwald

[Meiringen to Gindelwald](https://schweizmobil.ch/en/hiking-in-switzerland/route-1/stage-10)

Today we discovered the Bernese Oberland! There is nothing like it.

Today's stage was supposed to start with another stiff climb up to the Reichenbach Falls, apparently famous from Sherlock Holmes stories. But we'd learned bad habits, and decided to take the post bus up the hill to skip the climb -- and the falls, but we saw lots of waterfalls.

This was another cloudy morning. Once we'd used an internal combustion engine to ascend, we could enjoy the most lovely flat walk next to a little stream continuing into a primordial forest. 

![We started the walk alongside a mountain stream.](images/Meiringen_stream_IMG_7118.MOV)

![A yodeling festival?](images/Meiringen_yodel_IMG_7119.jpg)

![Hello, ducklings!](images/Meiringen_ducks_IMG_7137.jpg)

![Dairy cattle tend to be bony because all their energy goes into making milk.](images/Meiringen_cows_IMG_7154.jpg)

I was feeling strong today! Climbing had become easy, and remained easy thereafter.

Coming out of the forest, we saw our first really big mountains. That gave us an inkling of what lay ahead. 

![Are those gigantic mountains lurking in the clouds?](images/Meiringen_first_glimpse_bigmountains_IMG_7168.jpg)

![Almost up to the day's pass, the Grosse Scheidegg!](images/GrosseScheidegg_approach_IMG_7186.mov)

We climbed up and up to the [Grosse Scheidegg]() (big watershed) pass -- and there lay the Bernese Oberland, with the Eiger just as big as life.

![Is that the Eiger peeking out above the clouds?](images/Eiger_first_view_IMG_7201.jpg)

There's a hotel restaurant at the top of the Grosse Scheidegg, but the place was slammed with tourists and service seemed unlikely. We sat on the grass to eat our snacks while gazing on the Eiger. Picnic Eier remained a solid choice! (Some places sell their boiled eggs dyed bright orange, I suppose to prevent people from accidentally mixing them up with raw eggs.)

![The hotel at the Grosse Scheidegg -- a great place for lunch with a view, if you can get anyone to serve you.](images/GrosseScheidegg_hotel_IMG_7203.jpg)

Our route was supposed to take us down into the valley toward Grindelwald, but it seemed a shame to squander our elevation when there was a lovely balcony trail (really a gravel/paved road) curving around the high right side of the valley, with glorious views across to the Eiger the whole way. 

![This is a wonderful walk!](images/GrosseScheidegg_trail_IMG_7205.jpg)

![Most of these cyclists are on electric bicycles, which makes their lives considerably easier.](images/Grindelwald_cyclists_IMG_7209.MOV)

![A high farm, looking across the valley to the Eiger's range](images/Grindelwald_high_farm_IMG_7216.jpg)

We took this road to First, where a gondola runs down the mountainside to Grindelwald. The gondola was outrageously expensive, but then it covered a LOT of distance, which made the price worthwhile.

![It's a long ride down!](images/Grindelwald_cablecar_IMG_7231.jpg)

A note on cutting distances: today's stage was supposed to be about 23 kilometers with 1390 m ascent and 950 m descent. That is too much for us. We were much, much happier starting and finishing with transporation assistance!

![And now we're in a real town.](images/Grindelwald_IMG_7239.jpg)

Grindelwald was a shock. It's extremely touristic, much more so than Engelberg was. We stopped in the Montbell store, where I coveted many things but purchased nothing; we were packed very light. Chris did buy a wool t-shirt with an ibex on it. Montbell is funny -- the name suggests a Swiss company, but it's actually a Japanese outdoor company that specializes in super lightweight gear.

Paragliders wafted in and out of the gaps between peaks.

We despaired of finding a restaurant to our liking for dinner. Our hotel room had a balcony facing the Eiger, and it seemed perverse to squander the sunset hours anywhere else. We stopped in a Migros to buy groceries and had a private balcony party that evening. 

![Chris does a little map work on the balcony.](images/Grindelwald_map_IMG_7243.jpg)

![Our picnic!](images/Grindelwald_picnic_IMG_7245.jpg)

We watched the tourist crowds in the street below, playing mini golf and drinking beer and listening to a live band doing an open-air street concert. All that evening, not one of them looked up to see the peak that makes Grindelwald famous.

![This street was closed off for live music.](images/Grindelwald_street_IMG_7246.jpg)

![Grindelwald mini golf](images/Grindelwald_minigolf_IMG_7247.jpg)

Whatever other tourists want to do, we weren't going to skip a moment of Eiger-watching. We had a perfect view of the mountains at sunset. We watched for hours as the Eiger peeked in and out of the ubiquitous clouds and finally became almost clear at nightfall. 

![Beautiful sunset](images/Grindelwald_evening_IMG_7255.jpg)

![The light on the ridge is the Mitteleggi Hutte, where Eiger climbers can spend the night before summiting the next morning. That ridge walk is something I do NOT want to do!](images/Eiger_Mitteleggi_IMG_7289.jpg)


## Thursday July 28: Grindelwald to Wengen

[Grindelwald to Wengen](https://schweizmobil.ch/en/hiking-in-switzerland/route-1/stage-11)

Today was Eiger-day! We had watched the movie, and we were ready!

![Dawn rose on a clearly visible Eiger.](images/Eiger_dawn_IMG_7298.jpg)

We got up early to catch the [Wengernalpbahn cog railroad](https://www.jungfrau.ch/en-gb/corporate/jungfrau-railways/jungfraubahn-holding-ag/wengernalpbahn-ag/) that would take us part of the way up the trail. 

![Cog railroads use gears on these cogs to prevent runaway trains on steep terrain. They're a step below funiculars, which have cables in addition to cogs and are used on steeper terrain.](images/Eiger_cogs_IMG_7319.jpg)

![There goes the train! Tissot is a major sponsor of Alpine tourism.](images/Eiger_train_IMG_7324.mov)

![We got off at Grund and walked up to Alpiglen and stopped for a coffee. And a bathroom break. The Bernese Oberland is not the place to pee behind a rock.](images/Alpiglen_coffee_IMG_7343.jpg)

And then... we thought about how to spend the day. We'd been following our route cards so far, but they had us walking straight to [Kleine Scheidegg](https://www.thecatandthepeacock.com/blog/vintage-swiss-alps-kleine-scheidegg-and-the-wetterhorn), the pass opposite the Grosse Scheidegg, and then on toward Wengen, in the next valley over. A gorgeous walk, to be sure. But here we were, directly under the Eiger. The sun was actually out for once. And there was the [Eiger Trail](images/https://www.myswitzerland.com/en-us/experiences/route/eiger-trail-the-swiss-alpine-experience-trail/), which runs right under the north face of the darn Eiger! 

We're all about the quick pivot. On a beautiful day like this, the course of wisdom was to strike out on our own and walk the Eiger trail. We could take a train to Wengen if we had to!

Never have we made a more sound decision. This day more than any other stands out in my mind as the beating heart of our whole Via Alpina.

![The trail was surprisingly hard for such a touristic route, steep in places.](images/Eiger_rocky_IMG_7364.jpg)

![A comfy spot for a break!](images/Eiger_Amy_rocks_IMG_7592.jpg)

![The thing about this being the north face is that the sun is never directly on it, making it surprisingly hard to photograph. But here you can see the little windows opening into the train tunnel.](images/Eiger_nordwand_IMG_7440.jpg)

After our detailed study of the Nordwand from the movie and our own reading, we could spot all the geographic points of interest - the windows looking into the tunnel, the Spider, the "Death Bivouac" (surprisingly spacious and comfy!). 

![Right under the Nordwand! It looks so close, but it's really a heck of a long way up to the top.](images/Eiger_Chris_rightthere_IMG_7478.jpg)

![The Mönch is starting to come into view.](images/Eiger_Monch_IMG_7487.jpg)

![You can see all the way back to the Kleine Scheidegg and beyond.](images/Eiger_lookback_IMG_7489.jpg)

It a longer walk than we'd anticipated -- with no cover, and therefore no place for a lady to pee. And it was uphill all the way. Evidently most people walk this thing in the other direction, taking the cablecar up to the Jungfraujoch station and walking down to Alpiglen. (If you go that way, it's downhill all the way.)


![The approach to the pass is pretty rocky.](images/Eiger_pass_approach_IMG_7514.jpg)

![We finally reached the pass, where the Eiger merges into the Mönch and then the Jungfrau. These tourists all did it the easy way!](images/Eiger_pass_IMG_7530.jpg)

![This is how the tourists we saw got up there. It's quick, if you don't mind the price.](images/Eiger_cablecar_IMG_7544.jpg)

![And there's the Kleine Scheidegg, with our destination beyond it. We'll definitely be taking a train!](images/Kleine_Scheidegg_IMG_7538.jpg)

From the pass, you can walk up to the Jungfraujoch station, but we headed down and north to the Kleine Scheidegg proper -- a surprisingly exposed and narrow trail.

![And the clouds started to close in, as they always do after noon.](images/Eiger_disappearing_IMG_7549.jpg)

![And now we're moving on to the Mönch and the Jungfrau.](images/Monch_JF_IMG_7571.jpg)

We finally reached the Kleine Scheidegg, the only one of our alpine passes with its own railroad station. The [Hotel Bellevue des Alpes](https://www.scheidegg-hotels.ch/index_e.php) has sat under the Eiger since [1840](https://swiss-historic-hotels.ch/en/hotels/hotel-bellevue-des-alpes). This hotel features in *Nordwand*, though we couldn't match movie viewing locations with the reality, since the big terrace is on the far side of the building from the Eiger.

![To celebrate our encounter with the Eiger, we shared a bottle of prosecco on the terrace.](images/Hotel_bellevue_terrace_IMG_7588.jpg)

![They make a mean apricot tart.](images/Hotel_bellevue_apricot_tart_IMG_7591.jpg)

On some future trip, it might be fun to spend a night up there on the Kleine Scheidegg. Hotel Bellevue is a little spendy and it's hard to get reservations, but it's a real historic site.

We were supposed to walk the rest of the way to Wengen, but it was after 3, Wengen was still long way off, and the clouds were closing in, as they always do in the afternoon. We boarded the cog railroad in the direction of Wengen and left the station just as a thunderstorm arrived. We passed several hikers on our putative route as the train descended through the forest -- poor bastards!

![Goodbye Eiger! We love you lots!](images/Eiger_goodbye_IMG_7600.jpg)

![Our only close contact with the Mönch](images/Monch_IMG_7604.jpg)

In Wengen, we walked through the rain to an outdoor shop, where bought a pair of sunglasses for me and an On baseball cap for Chris -- he'd been jealous of mine.

## Friday July 29: Wengen to Mürren

![Morning in Wengen, and we've switched from the Eiger to the Jungfrau!](images/Wengen_mist_IMG_7610.mov)

A short walk today! The full stage is only 9.6 km, and it's easy to eliminate some or most of it with a cablecar up and then a train to town, turning this into a nominal rest day.

Leaving Wengen, we walked steeply downhill to the valley and the town of Lauterbrunnen. 

![This shot looking in the direction we're heading is the same view Alpine Exploratory uses to sell the entire Via Alpina! We were lucky to have light on it.](images/Wengen_descent_IMG_7628.jpg)

![There's a famous waterfall somewhere in there, but we didn't see it.](images/Wengen_valley_IMG_7633.jpg)

![Lauterbrunnen is in the valley.](images/Lauterbrunnen_IMG_7637.jpg)

![This is the sign advertising the Via Alpina marathon; the runners had all passed us days ago.](images/Race_sign_IMG_7638.jpg)

In Lauterbrunnen, we took the cablecar up to the balcony trail. From there, it was a simple two-hour walk on a flat balcony all the way to Mürren. There were great views of the Jungfrau and Mönch, and even the Eiger peeked out in the background. 

![The big three!](images/Murren_big_three_IMG_7645.jpg)

![It was nice to have an easy trail today.](images/Murren_trail_IMG_7653.jpg)

![A little railroad runs right next to this trail. Tourists who don't want to walk can ride into Mürren along with suitcases that are being transferred.](images/Murren_traintrack_IMG_7663.jpg)

We only passed a few other hikers, one of whom smelled like pizza; some hikers really get into the nature thing and don't bathe much.

The rain arrived as we got to the car-free town of Mürren. We were too early to get into our room at Hotel Eiger, so we walked around pointlessly, seeing what was to be seen. The place is set up for tourism, of course. At lunch we heard uncomfortable amounts of American. My Goretex Shakedry jacket, which I loved for its ultra light weight and stylish sheen, turned out to be no longer waterproof. Alas, but better to discover this in town than on the trail.

The [Hotel Eiger](https://hoteleiger.com/en/), though -- it was luxurious! This was our only 4-star hotel, and it was well worth getting there early to enjoy it. Our bedroom had a sitting area and even a patio, not that we want to sit out there in the rain. We went down to the pool, where we swam next to a floor-to-ceiling view of the Jungfrau in the mist. I finished in the sauna, though Chris fled after a glimpse of some dude's wayward genitals. 

![The terrace has a view of the Jungfrau.](images/Murren_terrace_IMG_7672.jpg)

After an aperitif, we had a perfect dinner of chateaubriand and meringue glacée, just like Chalet Brandt used to make. 

![Chateaubriand in the Bernese Oberland](images/Chateaubriand_IMG_7680.jpg)

![Meringe glacée. My brother won his future wife's affections by taking her to Chalet Brandt to get this for dessert back when they were in high school.](images/IMeringue_MG_7681.jpg)

This was definitely the best hotel we stayed in!


## Saturday July 30: Mürren to Griesalp

[Mürren to Griesalp]((https://schweizmobil.ch/en/hiking-in-switzerland/route-1/stage-12))

This was the most gorgeous hotel breakfast buffet of the whole trip. I deeply regretted that today was also one of the most demanding stages, which counseled against taking advantage of the bottle of champagne buried deep in ice in a silver urn.

![My breakfast. Note the absence of champagne.](images/Murren_breakfast_IMG_7686.jpg)

![Breakfast view. You see why this place charges the big bucks!](images/Murren_view_IMG_7689.jpg)

But today we were facing the first of the three highest passes: the [Sefinenfurgga](https://www.komoot.com/highlight/941489). We left plenty early to give ourselves ample time.

![Heading out of Mürren.](images/Murren_heading_out_IMG_7691.jpg)

![Mürren really is very small!](images/Murren_IMG_7693.jpg)

Alpine Exploratory had suggested that we take the Im Suppe route, arguing that the standard direct route was "unreasonably steep." Ha!, we said. The wise hiker takes the short route no matter what, especially if he's worried about distance.

Well. Yeah, the direct route is steep. Terrifyingly so. 

![Oh. We have to climb this.](images/Murren_climb_IMG_7704.jpg)

![Trying not to contemplate the drop to my left](images/Murren_Amy_climb_IMG_7723.jpg)

![Ugh](images/Murren_steep_IMG_7726.MOV)

![I'm focused on the grasses and spiderweb, not what's beyond them.](images/Murren_steep_IMG_7729.jpg)

But we made it, which gave us the payoff of the most gorgeous green balcony walk to the [Rotstockhütte](https://rotstockhuette.ch/index.php/en).

![The view is worth the climb.](images/Murren_view_IMG_7732.jpg)

![So dramatic!](images/Murren_balcony_IMG_7741.mov)

![The Rotstockhütte off in the valley, with the rest of our route beyond. This would certainly be a remote place to spend a night!](images/Rotstockhutte_IMG_7752.jpg)

![Finally made it to the hut!](images/Rotstockhutte_IMG_7761.jpg)

At the Rotstockhütte, we fell in with the schedule of an Alpenwild group hiking the same route. This was a bit regrettable, because there were a lot of them and the Sefinafurgga isn't very big. On the other hand, we were moving very slowly.

![Leaving the Rotstockhütte.](images/Rotstockhutte_leaving_IMG_7765.jpg)

![We headed up this valley.](images/Sefina_beginning_IMG_7806.jpg)


The walk to the Sefinafurgga is beautiful -- wild and glacial. The approach to the pass itself is ridiculously steep, so steep that the trail managers had added a ladder to the top of the scree, most likely just to preserve the mountainside.

![Getting closer to the pass.](images/Sefina_approach_IMG_7842.MOV)

![Wait, that's the TRAIL?](images/Sefina_waitwhat_IMG_7845.jpg)

![Chris making it up the steep climb.](images/Sefina_Chris_IMG_7867.jpg)

![The ladders are the last stage.](images/Sefina_ladder_IMG_7871.jpg)

![The Sefinenfurgga is the smallest pass we've encountered so far. And it feels like you could fall off either side!](images/Sefina_IMG_7874.jpg)

![Looking back the way we came.](images/Sefina_lookforward_IMG_7876.jpg)

![And looking forward to our next stop.](images/Sefina_lookback_IMG_7875.jpg)


The view from the top was gorgeous, not gonna lie, but the longer I sat on that knife ridge, the less likely it felt that I would ever get up and walk down the other side. The other side consisted of more scary steps and ropes. The Swiss and Germans don't seem nearly as bothered by this terrain, though perhaps there's a selection process that has already happened. After the steps and ropes ended, there was nothing but a massive, steep, slippery scree field. I don't love that terrain.

![It's steep, but it's slippery!](images/Sefina_descent_IMG_7881.jpg)

![The Griesalp side consists of what feels like hours of scree.](images/Sefina_scree_IMG_7889.jpg)

![Chris does a great job walking through the scree.](images/Sefina_scree_IMG_7901.MOV)

Anyway! We made it through, and then there was nothing but a very long, very green meadow walk down and down all the way to Griesalp.

NB: One option to consider for this stage would be to make the previous day's walk longer and to spend the night at the Rotstockhütte. That would mean a night in an Alpine hut instead of the swanky Hotel Eiger, but it would make the two days' walks' more balanced, instead of a super-short day to stay in an expensive town followed by a long and difficult one. If we ever do this route again, I'd argue for doing something like that.

![Shepherds put paint sacks on the rams' chests so they mark the ewes when they "service" them."](images/Sefina_sheep_IMG_7918.jpg)

![Is tomorrow's pass over there? Egads!](images/Sefina_Hohturli_IMG_7924.jpg)

![Griesalp is still a long way down that valley.](images/Griesalp_approach_IMG_7930.jpg)

![Llama farm](images/Griesalp_llamas_IMG_7946.jpg)

![Griesalp, finally!](images/Griesalp_IMG_7948.jpg)

Griesalp is barely a town, really more just a collection of hostels. Our hotel had advertised a sauna and hot tub, but our efforts to avail ourselves of these faciities were in vain. The girls running the place and I couldn't manage to communicate effectively -- I think there was a fundamental misunderstanding regarding what facilities even existed. They kept talking about "hot pots," which was mysterious.

![It was nice to stop walking and finally relax!](images/Griesalp_drinks_IMG_7947.jpg)

It had been a long day. We went to bed early.


## Sunday July 31: Griesalp to Kandersteg

[Griesalp to Kandersteg](https://schweizmobil.ch/en/hiking-in-switzerland/route-1/stage-13)

Today's route went up and over the Hohtürli, the highest and scariest of the three high, scary passes that come in the middle of the Via Alpina. After being scared out of my wits on the Sefinafurgga yesterday, I had no desire to approach something even more frightening. In addition, it was a weekend and tomorrow was a national holiday, which meant the trails would be crowded -- and the last thing I wanted to face was pressure to move faster or to get out of the way. We agreed to blow off the hike and just take the bus and train to Kandersteg.

Griesalp is maybe the highest Postbus stop in Switzerland. As always, the postbus and train were very easy to navigate. We were in Kandersteg before our morning coffee had worn off.

![Scenic Kandersteg, much less hectic than Engelberg.](images/Kandersteg_IMG_8001.jpg)

![A charming church](images/Kandersteg_church_IMG_7978.jpg)

![Hotel Benerhof](images/Kandersteg_hotel_IMG_7979.jpg)

It's always anticlimactic, though, to arrive at a destination many hours too early. Our [hotel](https://www.bernerhof.ch/en/hotel/hotel) wasn't ready for us. We had nothing to do.

And so we ended up walking from central Kandersteg up all the way to the Oeschinensee (the famous local mountain lake), doing the end of today's hike in reverse and uphill, and a hard, hot walk it was! We found ourselves in the company of numerous Israeli teenagers out on a school outing -- nice kids who were very proud of their (admirable!) English language skills!

![The Oeschinensee, a glacial lake.](images/Oeschinensee_IMG_7968.jpg)

![Walking back to the mountains! This trail is wheelchair accessible and leads to the cablecar.](images/Kandersteg_trail_IMG_7952.jpg)

![I soaked my feet in the See, which was very cold. It felt VERY nice!](images/Oeschinensee_Amy_feet_IMG_7816.jpg)

![We had lunch on a terrace overlooking the Oeschinensee. They of course had the ever-present meringues with fresh local strawberries.](images/Oeschinensee_meringue_IMG_7966.jpg)

We'd agreed to take the cablecar back down to town, but even reaching the station involved a half hour walk uphill. 

![We could see across the valley to the next stage of our trek, including the next pass: the Bünderchrinde.](images/Kandersteg_looking_forward_IMG_7973.jpg)

In Kandersteg, we got into our hotel room and began our rest! The first step was to wash some clothes to give them maximum time to dry, though on our sunny balcony this ended up taking no time.

![We watched the sun go down as we dined on the hotel's terrace.](images/Kandersteg_sunset_IMG_7987.jpg)

![The mountains really did turn that bright orange!](images/Kandersteg_sunset_IMG_7997.jpg)


## Monday August 1: Rest day in Kandersteg

Rest day! We slept late and had a beautiful sunny breakfast on terrace. 

Rest days really are important on longer trips. Not only are they a great chance to get clothes washed and maybe do some shopping, rest really is important. Fatigue can build up, especially if the walks are strenuous, long, or frightening. Just having to pack up every morning is a minor source of stress.

After breakfast, we walked around town to scout out tomorrow’s route, somewhat visible on the mountains to the west. We were most interested in locating the little cablecar we wanted to take for the first ascent. 

This didn't take very long.

Having exhausted Kandersteg's entertainment possibilies, we took the touristic cablecar back up to the Oeschinensee. The hotel gave us vouchers that we could use for our fare; there were all kinds of deals available on this trip, but mostly we didn't manage to make use of them. 

![Walking back to the Oeschinensee, this time from above.](images/Oeschinensee_IMG_8003.jpg)

![Today I actually went swimming. The water was so cold! The rocky bottom is hard underfoot.](images/Oeschinensee_Amy_IMG_7843.jpg)

![It felt EXTREMELY good to float on this lake with mountains all around.](images/Oeschinensee_Amy_swim_IMG_7867.jpg)

![I tried not to think about these cows and the water quality. Though I also tried not to get the water in my mouth.](images/Oeschinensee_cows_IMG_8008.jpg)

We returned to the cablecar terrace and sat for a while watching tourists drive go-carts. I worried about the Indian women and their long hair.

![The ski lift has a sunny terrace, popular with visitors.](images/Kandersteg_terrace_IMG_8013.jpg)

![Chris got us these hotdogs.](images/Hotdog_IMG_8016.jpg)

Back in our room, we watched *Return of the Pink Panther,* which Chris chose entirely because part of it is set in Gstaad. All central European tourism still seems to me thoroughly mired in the 1970s.

![The hotel owners are definitely cat people.](images/Cat_sign_IMG_8017.jpg)

In the evening, we sat on the terrace and watched the parapenters soaring about lazily. Chris said he wouldn't mind learning how to do that one day.

Today was Swiss Independence day. There were festivities throughout town, with boy scouts and girl scouts from around the world.

![The hotel served us a special Swiss dessert as part of the set menu.](images/Swiss_dessert_IMG_8057.jpg)

I'd spent the day debating whether I was too scared to walk the Bunderchrinde, the last of the three high passes and the mid-point of tomorrow's route. Before we went to bed, I announced that we would hike the Bunderchrinde tomorrow. I don't want to talk myself out of things I can actually do.


## Tuesday August 2: Kandersteg to Adelboden

[Kandersteg to Adelboden](https://schweizmobil.ch/en/hiking-in-switzerland/route-1/stage-14)

Okay, today was a day to face my fears head on!

We got up early for another breakfast on the terrace. We walked to the base of the tiny Almenalp cablecar and rode up to the balcony path. 

![The Almenalp cable car. A lot of these cars are facultative, running when there are customers. Sometimes you can call from the top to get the operator down below to carry you down in the car.](images/Kandersteg_cablecar_IMG_8061.jpg)

![We got out by a farmhouse. This would be a heck of a location to farm!](images/Kandersteg_farm_IMG_8063.jpg)

![A sign pointing to various paths. We went left, to Usser Uschine.](images/Kandersteg_sign_IMG_8064.jpg)

In principle, we could've just walked straight into the mountains behind that farmhouse and straight on to Adelboden. The advice, though, is that anyone scared of exposure should avoid the Bunderspitz ("[To say that this hike is steep is an understatement....](https://www.hikingwalking.com/index.php/destinations/sw/sw_bernese/kandersteg/bunderspitz)). And people say the Bunderchrinde is scary!

To make our lives less scary and increase the odds that I would end the day in Adelboden and not paralyzed on some peak in the Kandertal, we followed the balcony trail (really a gravel road used by farmers) around to Usser Ushine, where there is a little coffee shop.

![Gravel roads make for easy walking.](images/Usser_dirtroad_IMG_8087.jpg)

![Cows don't seem to mind steep terrain.](images/Usser_cow_IMG_8088.jpg)

![I believe this is Usser Uschine? The trail follows that dirt road down the middle of the valley and then turns sharply upward on the other side of those trees.](images/Usser_valley_IMG_8108.jpg)

![This was an extremely primitive coffee shop, which might not have even had plumbing.](images/Usser_coffehouse_IMG_8114.jpg)

![It was such a beautiful day for a green walk!](images/Usser_Amy_climb_IMG_7885.MOV)

And then, we went up. Up and up. This part of the Alps -- it's just steep, especially toward the tops of peaks. The Bunderchrinde, which we were hiking, is actually the gentle and easy alternative to other ways over this ridge into the next valley. And certainly lots of people skip up the thing without a thought to heights.

They are Swiss. I grew up in Louisiana.

![The trail is getting steep.](images/Usser_steep_IMG_8142.jpg)

![Cows do occasionally fall off these cliffs.](images/Bunder_cows_IMG_8174.jpg)

![If we'd come straight up from the cablecar, we could've ended up on this ridge.](images/Bunder_ridge_IMG_8194.MOV)

![The ridge surprisingly didn't feel that exposed and had a great view.](images/Bunder_ridge_IMG_7891.jpg)

![That was a minor detour from our actual path; the Bunderchrinde is in the opposite direction of that green ridge.](images/Bunder_start_approach_IMG_8197.jpg)

Anyway, the Bunderchrinde -- that was some exposed, nasty, narrow, slippery scary shit! I gollemed my way up the steeper parts.

![Now we're in the ascent proper; it's all scree and loose rock from here.](images/Bunder_scree_IMG_8198.jpg)

![This blaze says we're still on target. This bit involved some skirting of rock faces. Our route cards advised caution, observing that "a slip would be hard to stop.](images/Bunder_sign_IMG_8203.jpg)

![A very bad handheld video shot by a terrified photographer.](images/Bunder_arrive_IMG_8205.MOV)

![The Bunderchrinde! The panorama makes it look much broader than it is, but you can see that it's down on both sides.](images/Bunder_pano_IMG_8210.jpg)

![We're just way up there.](images/Bunder_us_IMG_7908.jpg)

![And that's the way down. It's steep. And loose!](images/Bunder_descent_IMG_8208.jpg)

I used the butt traverse to descend that first part. In the future, I should remember to wear tougher and longer pants and some gloves -- then the butt descent down scree would be no problem.

![Scree fields are not only difficult to walk down, they're ugly too!](images/Bunder_scree_IMG_7915.jpg)

![Finally, some grassy terrain!](images/Bunder_meadow_start_IMG_8224.jpg)

![One last look at our friendly Bunderchrinde.](images/Bunder_backside_IMG_8227.jpg)

![A much-needed rest. I am tired and dirty!](images/Bunder_rest_IMG_7926.jpg)

We finally got back into grassy meadow terrain, but had to keep on walking and walking downhill. We did have a nice stop for ice cream and meringue. Then it was just a long walk down.

![Looking down at Adelboden.](images/Adelboden_amy_IMG_7933.jpg)

![You can never eat too many meringues.](images/Adelboden_meringue_IMG_8255.jpg)

![More green valley but no town in sight.](images/Adelboden_valley_IMG_8261.jpg)

![We're finally getting close to town!](images/Adelboden_IMG_8274.jpg)

The sad thing about Adelboden is just when you've reached town, you realize you're at the bottom of it. We waited a little while for the suggested bus, but that clearly wasn't going to happen. It was another steep climb up to the hotel at the very end, much like arriving in Namche Bazaar.

The hotel [Bristol Adelboden](https://en.bristol-adelboden.com) had a set menu for dinner, which was nice, because we were much too tired to make decisions.

![For example, I didn't have to decide to have more ice cream.](images/Adelboden_icecream_IMG_8305.jpg)


## Wednesday August 3: Adelboden to Lenk

[Adelboden to Lenk](https://schweizmobil.ch/en/hiking-in-switzerland/route-1/stage-15)

Adelboden was yet another town that might well be a charming place to stay, but where we had no time to do anything but try to recover from one day's walk and build up stores for the next. It has lots of outdoor shops, anyway.

Today was another easy walk. We took a flat path up the river to a cablecar that transported us up to the long balcony walk called the Blumenweg, or flower path. It was truly beautiful.

![We could've taken a cablecar right from town, but the walk under it was flat and easy.](images/Adelboden_start_IMG_8308.jpg)

![At the top of the cablecar and ready to roll!](images/Adelboden_go_IMG_8309.jpg)

![Today's pass, the Hahnenmoospass, was flat and grassy. You can see it in the saddle on the ridge at the end of the valley.](images/Adelboden_vista_IMG_8333.jpg)

![There's nothing wrong with a pretty, easy trail every now and then.](images/Adelboden_trail_IMG_8330.mov)

This area is built up with various tourism options. The trail is paved in places to facilitate the use of mountain bikes and scooters, which look terrifying to me. This particular path is also very popular with older people and anyone who wants a pretty walk with pretty views without having to kill themselves climbing up or down on rugged terrain.

![Moo.](images/Adelboden_cows_IMG_8339.jpg)

![A glider club likes to meet on the Hahnenmoospass to fly their toy airplanes.](images/Adelboden_toy_planes_IMG_8344.jpg)

![There's a Texas longhorn ranch on the far side of the pass.](images/Adelboden_longhorns_IMG_8347.jpg)

![Chris loves parapenters and was ready for this guy to succeed -- he'd spent SO LONG laying out his parachute and all the lines, it's really too bad that fence was there!](images/IMG_8361.MOV)

We tried to get lunch at the [Metsch cablecar](https://lenk-simmental.ch/en/our-simmental/good-to-know/cable-cars/cable-cars-in-summer) station but it was too crowded, so we just took the car down to the valley. We could've done a long walk through the Simmefall waterfall, but chose not to.

![We no longer underestimate descents, especially when they're still miles from the destination. Even this cable car ride took several minutes -- the tops of the mountains are NOT close to the valleys.](images/Lenk_cablecar_down_IMG_8367.jpg)

At the bottom of the cablecar, it was a simple, flat walk along a river into town. Our [hotel](https://www.krone-lenk.ch/en/home/hotel) was oddly unstaffed -- everyone's keys were laid out on a desk with their names, but no one was there. We went swimming in the hotel's pool, where the owner's grandsons were cavorting for hours. We attempted to use the sauna but couldn't figure out how to turn it on, and there was no one to ask for help.

We took a walk and saw that the local high school, out of session for the summer, had turned its cafeteria into a lunch place, clearly aimed at retirees. The menu and prices looked pretty good, but we thought we would feel out of place. And also, we didn't spend all this money to come to Switzerland and eat at a high school cafeteria.

The town felt very dead. Instead of looking for an evening's entertainment, we got dinner supplies at the Coop and had another private balcony party at our hotel. It's a treat to be able to sit and watch the sun go down on the mountains.

![Lenk sunset](images/Lenk_sunset_IMG_8371.jpg)


## Thursday August 4: Lenk to Gstaad

[Lenk to Gstaad](https://schweizmobil.ch/en/hiking-in-switzerland/route-1/stage-16)

We tried to get an early start today but discovered that the hotel breakfast didn't even begin until 8. Oh well. We didn't need hotel breakfast. We ate the bread and cheese left over from dinner on our balcony and then went downstairs for a quick coffee.

That was such a weird hotel.

Because today's stage was nearly 23 kilometers, we once again availed ourselves of the cablecar, which we took to [Leiterli/Betelberg](https://www.myswitzerland.com/en-us/experiences/leiterli-betelberg-pure-alps-culture/). 

![Swiss trails are dotted with gates of various types. This one is part of an artistic/musical display.](images/Lenk_gate_IMG_8386.MOV)

![Oh what a beautiful valley!](images/Lenk_valley_IMG_8411.MOV)

We walked the [most beautiful balcony path](https://schweizmobil.ch/en/hiking-in-switzerland/route-313) -- which abruptly transformed into a terrifying exposed landscape of narrow limestone paths and deep sinkholes. This is known as the [Gryden](https://betelberg.ch). No one else seems scared by this stuff....

![The Gryden, yay.](images/IMG_8419.jpg)

![A particularly slippery and slanted bit.](images/IMG_8418.jpg)

![I managed to get through, even if it wasn't pretty and these old Swiss guys were just tromping by in their boots.](images/IMG_8015.MOV)

![It was the drop on the side that bugged me.](images/IMG_8017.jpg)

Then we went through Trutlisbergpass. This pass wasn't a big deal -- we almost didn't notice that we'd crossed one.

![Chris regrouping for the next stage of the hike.](images/IMG_8423.jpg)

![These might have been young male cattle hanging out for their fun summer before adult responsibilities. They were going nuts.](images/Lenk_cows_running_IMG_8435.MOV)

Then it was a sweet and easy descent into and through a long valley to the town of Wintermatt. 

![The trail runs to the right of this hill and down through the valley.](images/Lenk_toward_Wintermatt_IMG_8446.jpg)

![It's a long but easy valley walk.](images/Lenk_Wintermatt_valley_IMG_8451.jpg)

![It's a little unnerving to have to walk through cows. They're gentle herbivores, but they're also really big and have horns.](images/Cows_walkthrough_IMG_8452.MOV)

![Hello, cows!](images/Lenk_cows_IMG_8454.jpg)

In Wintermatt, we found a busy country café still serving lunch. Families had flocked there in their cars, but it's also possible to walk here from Gstaad, which is a little over an hour away.

![Country café with healthful fresh air](images/Wintermatt_cafe_IMG_8455.jpg)

![We got a Käseschnitte mit Schinken. So good!](images/Wintermatt_kaseschnitte_IMG_8457.jpg)

We walked another hour and a half to reach Gstaad. Our route had us walking to Gsteig instead and taking a bus to Gstaad, but we saw no reason to do that when it was easy to walk straight into town and right to the [Hotel Gsaaderhof](https://www.gstaaderhof.ch/en/).

Aside from its weird name, which is a point of interest in its own right, I only know Gstaad from 1970s and 1980s movies that invoked it as a marker of cosmopolitan sophistication. (See, e.g., this scene from [*Trading Places*](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=trading+places+gstaad&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8#fpstate=ive&vld=cid:54ff6e98,vid:uYlOIKtYsos,st:0).) Also, [Julie Andrews](https://www.gstaadlife.com/2022/07/tribute-julie-andrews.html), Audrey Hepburn, and Peter Sellers favored it.

For our part, we found that we didn't have the energy to do yet another exploration of yet another Swiss resort town, especially not one with a shopping street lined with outrageously priced designer goods that we had no way to transport. We just ate at the hotel and called it good.

![The perplexing Saloon bar at the hotel, with a full-on "Western" decor and menu. We didn't get anything there.](images/Gstaad_saloon_IMG_8473.jpg)


## Friday August 5: Gstaad to L'Étivaz

[Gstaad to L'Étivaz](https://schweizmobil.ch/en/hiking-in-switzerland/route-1/stage-17)

The route of this section of the Via Alpina was in flux in 2022, hence yesterday's instructions to end our hike in Gsteig. This morning we were supposed to take the bus back to Gsteig to walk to our next destination at [Col des Mosses](https://www.alpesvaudoises.ch/en/Z83/col-des-mosses/destination-col-des-mosses). We decided not to do that and to instead walk straight from Gstaad to L'Étivaz, which is the current route.

We headed out for an early start, but discovered that the [Eggli cable car](https://bergbahnen-gstaad.ch/en/summer/information/rates) that we'd planned to take uphill didn't start running until 10. Oh well.

Once we got up to the higher trail, we had a lovely ridge and forest walk. We could sort of see the resort at the top of the [glacier](images/ColdeJable_cows_IMG_8513.jpg) that serves as a summer ski area in Gstaad. (We know of the existence of this glacier from *Return of the Pink Panther*, in which Lady Litton is reported to be skiing on a glacier in the middle of summer, though in fact she had gone to the tennis instead.)

Today's walk was quite easy, at least by Via Alpina standards, though it's possible that we skipped some harder trail by simply taking the dirt road much of the way.

Today, we crossed the Col de Jable, the pass that put us in French-speaking Switzerland.

The last descent was narrow, slippery, and scary at times -- Alpine trails never stop frightening me at least a little. Our goal was the town of [L'Étivaz](https://schweizmobil.ch/en/place-331-l'etivaz), where we intended to catch a bus up to Col des Mosses. (Yes, we were supposed to walk to Col des Mosses. Enough already!)

![L'Etivaz. As we were descending this slope, three young people sprinted past us down the hill. They knew the bus schedule....](images/LEtivaz_IMG_8548.jpg)

We arrived in town right just after those three young people jumpted onto the bus we wanted and it drove away, which meant we had to wait an hour for the next one. 

![We spent the time enjoying a snack of potato chips, ice cream, and cokes, like we were American middle-schoolers.](images/Letivaz_snack_IMG_8551.jpg)

![These shoes had given me good service over 300+ kilometers! But I decided it was time to retire them.](images/LEtivaz_shoes_IMG_8552.jpg)

We spent the night at [Fleur des Alpes](https://www.fleurs-des-alpes.ch), a little guest house run by a sweet man in his mother's old home. He was delighted to discover that I could speak French. He served us a wonderful table d'hote for dinner.

We had a good chat with a Swiss family who lived in town and had just come for dinner with their kids. The degree of sophistication that most Swiss families display is impressive; the kids spoke good English already, and they'd all traveled extensively in the U.S.


## Saturday August 6: L'Étivaz to Montreux

We didn't walk any of this stage. If I recall correctly, today's distance was supposed to be something like 39 kilometers, with no realistic transport options to shorten it. That would've been out of the question regardless, but in our case we really did need to get to Montreux that morning to meet my brother and his family.

Needing an early start, we'd requested breakfast at 7:30. Our host was dismayed because the bakery wouldn't be open yet, but we insisted. 

![Our host set up a charming array of his own jams and honeys perfumed with the herbs he'd grown. Some of the honeys came from his aunt and her bees.](images/FleurdesAlpes_breakfast_IMG_8564.jpg)

Getting to Montreux is easy enough, though it did involve a bus and two trains. Walking out to the bus stop, we saw our host peddling his bicycle to the bakery for fresh croissants and baguettes.

![The scenery here is so different from the high mountains.](images/Montreux_countryside_IMG_8568.jpg)

We arrived around 10 and spent a lovely morning with family. It felt strange not to be walking in the mountains.

![We all have the same hat!](images/Montreux_hats_IMG_8570.jpg)

Montreux used to have a thriving music recording industry, hence the presence of the famous Freddie Mercury statute. The name "Montreux" is known in the U.S. mainly from the Deep Purple song "Smoke on the Water."  In case you don't remember (or perhaps have never heard this work of musical genius!), "Smoke on the Water" recounts the time the band went to make a record in a mobile studio but some "stupid with a flare gun burned the whole place down." The fire produced the "smoke on the water and fire in the sky." Must've been something to see. We had ice cream by the water, right in front of the Casino where Deep Purple ended up recording their record, after their studio burned down.

![I threw away my filthy Altras when we got to Montreux. The Bedrocks were now my only shoes.](images/Montreux_bedrocks_IMG_8590.jpg)

My brother's family headed off to Kandersteg, where they were about to embark on their own fun week of Bernese Oberland activities. Before they left, we set them up with the SBB app to make their transits easy.

Our room at [La Rouvenaz](https://rouvenaz.ch) had an odd setup -- the bathroom was walled in glass. Entirely. Turning on the light in the bathroom thus illuminated the entire bedroom. The arrangement detracted from privacy, too. Not turning on the light seemed like an option, except the bathroom had a motion sensor in it that turned on the lights whenever anyone walked in. The solution was to take our room card out of the electricity slot and simply have no power that night.


## Sunday August 7: Montreux to Zurich

Today we slept late for the first time in days!

I got up first and showered in the dark, so as not to awaken Chris. Then I went to breakfast so he could have some privacy in our panopticon bathroom.

![We spent the morning walking toward the castle on the lakeshore and back. Montreux seems like a pretty town.](images/Montreux_lake_IMG_8611.jpg)

Then it was time to start heading home. Our flight left the next day -- we didn't want to have to travel to the Zurich airport at the crack of dawn -- so we could take our time. 

It takes a little over 2.5 hours to get to Zurich HBF from Montreux. The train itinerary was easy as always. (Swiss trains seem to actually run on time, unlike trains in Germany.) It was odd to ride out of the mountains into rolling hills.

Zurich wasn't terribly interesting. The "Old Town" area is completely touristic now, and all these European cities have started to look the same.

![Zurich's sunset was pretty.](images/Zurich_sunset_IMG_8639.jpg)

And then the next morning, we went home! It's a ten-minute train ride from the main train station to the Zurich airport. Check-in was easy, as was security, but then we spent 45 minutes in passport control -- our lines kept disappearing as we approched the front, which was stressful.

But! We got through. We'd upgraded to business class, so we could enjoy the prime lounge. 

![The prime lounge has an outdoor deck with a great view of the runway.](images/Zurich_airport_IMG_8646.mov)

There's not much to say about flying home. Lie-flat beds are very nice, though I also found them weirdly isolating. I did get some work done on the plane, which never happens, so that was good. Global entry was super easy in Philly. Our son collected us in Charlotte, and we were in bed by 10.

And that was our Via Alpina! 

As of 2025, that was the last time we were in Switzerland. In 2023 and 2024, we did Greece -- MUCH cheaper, and professionally relevant -- and in 2025 we moved on to Nepal. The Alps were definitely good preparation for both of those.
