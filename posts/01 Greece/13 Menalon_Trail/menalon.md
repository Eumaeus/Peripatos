# The Menalon Trail

Amy had a day-by-day account of the Menalon trail. This post contains my impressions of it, and what I learned from walking on it.

## Six Days Hiking in Arcadia

>| Those who held Arcadia in Cyllene’s shadow
>| Beside Aepytus’ tomb, where men fight hand to hand,
>| And those in Pheneos and Orchomenos,
>| In Rhipe and Stratia and windy Enispe,
>| Those who held Tegea and Mantinea,
>| Those who held Stymphalus and lived in Parrhasia—
>| All these Agapenor led, Ancaeus’s son,
>| Fifty ships, and each had on board
>| Many Arcadians who knew how to fight.
>| Agamemnon himself had given them ships
>| To cross over the sea’s grey wine,
>| For the Arcadians knew nothing of sailing the sea.

>| οἳ δ’ ἔχον Ἀρκαδίην ὑπὸ Κυλλήνης ὄρος αἰπὺ

>| Ἀρκάδες ἄνδρες ἔβαινον ἐπιστάμενοι πολεμίζειν.
>| αὐτὸς γάρ σφιν δῶκεν ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν Ἀγαμέμνων

We just finished hiking the eight stages of the [Menalon Trail](https://menalontrail.eu/en/), in [Arcadia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcadia_(region)), in the center of the Peloponnese. It was great! We are exhausted. Our arrangements were made by the excellent [Trekking Hellas](https://trekking.gr/en/excursions/menalon-trail-hiking-tour-self-guided).

## Arcadia & Disney


Arcadia is the high central plateau of the Peloponnese, the large southern region of Greece, a penninsula connected to the northern mainland by the Isthmus of Corinth (to the east) and the modern Patras Bridge across the mouth of the Gulf of Corinth (to the west).

![Arcadia is exactly like this.](images/disney.jpg)

If you have any image of Arcadia in your mind, it might be from Disney’s *Fantasia*, the bit set to [Beethoven’s Pastoral Symphony (No. 6 in F major, Op. 68)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symphony_No._6_(Beethoven)). This symphony has five movements, each intended to paint a picture of a bucolic life:

1. “Erwachen heiterer Empfindungen bei der Ankunft auf dem Lande” (“	Awakening of cheerful feelings on arrival in the countryside”)
1. “Szene am Bach“ (“Scene by the brook”)
1. “Lustiges Zusammensein der Landleute”	(“Merry gathering of country folk”)
1. “Gewitter, Sturm“	(“Thunder, Storm”)
1. “Hirtengesang. Frohe und dankbare Gefühle nach dem Sturm” (“Shepherd's song. Cheerful and thankful feelings after the storm”)

Disney’s animators decided to set their scene in the Greek Arcadia of mythology, land of the god Pan, of merry-making, of wine, and of storms. After a week up here, I think they made an excellent call.

## The Menalon Trail

Greece, in general, and the people of Arcadia in particular are intensely proud of the [Menelon Trail](https://menalontrail.eu/en).

>(The picture on the official home page is of the village of Stemnitsa; the building directly under the green structure was the elegant guest-house, the [Belleiko Xenōnas, Μπελλείκο παραδοσιακός ξενώνας)](https://mpelleiko.gr/en/).

![Magical forest.](images/trees.jpg)

This is one of two trails in Greece certified by the [ERA (European Ramblers Association)](https://www.era-ewv-ferp.org/e-paths/)—the other is on Andros Island—which means that the maintenance and signage are up to the highest European standards (which are very high, based on our experiences in Switzerland, France, Italy, and Austria). 

![Basic trail blaze.](images/sign.jpg)

The trail is well-marked with these cool blazes. I am looking forward to showing these to my friend, Professor Ross McClain, who teaches art, and logo-design, at Furman University. The distinctive little swash is recognizable as a Greek “m” (‘μ’) and a Latin "em"; it also looks like a mountain-range.

The blazes are metal squares, the corners of which the trail-people can bend to turn the square into an arrow. Between these blazes and the `.gpx` files provided by [Trekking Hellas](https://trekking.gr/en/) we had little problem.

![A directional blaze. Clever!](images/sign2.jpg)

The trail is divided into eight sections, each beginning and ending at a town, village, or settlement (this distinction matters… see below!). Stemnitsa, Dimitsana, Zygovisti, Elati, Vytina, Nymphasia, Magouliana, Valtesiniko, Lagadia.

## Caveats 1: It is hard

The trail is *difficult*. The sections are given difficulty ratings, and most were, like, 3/5. I think Leonidas’ 300 hiked these and set the ratings. This is a **steep** trail. There is some dividing line where “steep hike” becomes “free solo”, and Menalon walks right up to the edge.

We spent five days, which meant that days 2, 3, and 4 were “double-stages”. Our daily distances and ascent were:

| Distance (miles) | Ascent (feet) |
|------------------|---------------|
| 7.76             | 2,707         |
| 11.86            | 2,982         |
| 8.76             | 1,539         |
| 9.62             | 2,714         |
| 8.63             | 1,956         |

For a total of 45.3 miles and 9,726 feet of elevation gained. The low point of the trail was 1,378 feet, and the high point was 6,636 feet. 

![Amy ascends.](images/amy.jpg)

We’ve done more distance and ascent on trails in the Swiss Alps, but Menalon doesn’t believe in that zig-zag thing for gaining altitude. Why zig and zag when you can go straight up!

Some parts of the trail are eroded, despite the best efforts of the maintainers (no different from what we’ve seen in Switzerland, but slippery, scary, and difficult nevertheless).

![The trail of often badly washed out.](images/bad_trail.jpg)

## Highlights

Many, many, many little monasteries perched on the sides of mountains. A long traverse through the gorge of the River Lousios, where the nymphs once bathed baby Zeus. Many sheep and goats, guarded by diligent dogs who scared the hell out of us but were content to see us pass by, pale and sweating.

![We never bothered with the guided tours of the monasteries. They were cool to look at, though.](images/monastery.jpg)

But when the trail was good, it could be perfectly beautiful. I’ve got a blog-post in the works on the elaborate taxonomy of highways, but suffice it to say that Menelon had us walking along woodland tracks, logging roads, ancient paths of commerce paved with cobbles of immemorial antiquity.

![When the path was good, it was magical.](images/pretty_trail.jpg)

## Caveats 2: Off-season travel

September is what the old Vermonters would call “’taint season”, as in “’taint summer, and ’taint skiing.” This didn’t matter so much up in Pelion, in the little beach resorts, where there were always a few tavernas to choose from. Rural Arcadia is another matter.

At our hotel in Nymphasia, for example, we were literally the only guests in this huge resort hotel. There was no restaurant or taverna in Nymphasia, at least none open during the week. So our hotel had a kind of "DoorDash" arrangement with a restaurant in Vytina, a 90-minute walk (I can tell you), but only a 5-minute drive away. You can’t count on grocery stores or pharmacies in any of these villages. There might be some, but they are probably closed. Or, closed during the afternoon, when you are hiking through.

![Every town in Arcadia looks like this.](images/village2.jpg)

Many times we missed the freedom afforded by our rented Skoda, which was parked at the trailhead in Stemnitsa, not to be rejoined until this morning, after a 75-minute cab-ride from Lagadia.

There was only one night when we failed to get dinner—the hotel’s restaurant closed at 7:00, which is when they usually open—and feasted on two granola bars we had stashed. Breakfast at that hotel made up for it. 

Season or no, tiny settlement or “major” village, breakfast was always plentiful and good fuel for the day’s walking.

The water along the trail is plentiful and wholesome!

## Missing History

Being in Arcadia makes me realize the vast gap in my own historical knowledge and education. Name a city in Arcadia! My colleagues who read Homer know the region from the [Catalog of Ships, (*Iliad*, 2.603-2.614)](). Everyone knows about Sparta, which is sort-of adjacent to Arcadia, but down on a plain (I’m looking at it now, from my hotel balcony in Mystras).

Sparta was a big deal, in my education, until it wasn’t. Thebes, and the Theban general, the genius [Epaminondas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epaminondas), defeated Sparta at the [Battle of Leuctra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Leuctra) in 371 BCE. The Spartan [King Agis III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agis_III) managed a brief revolt against Macedonian rule in 333 BCE. It failed, and Sparta lost the last vestiges of independence when [King Nabis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nabis_of_Sparta) lost a war against the Achaean League in 191 BCE. Somewhere in there, my historical education started ignoring Sparta, Arcadia, and the whole Peloponnese. 

The place became “vacation-land” for the Romans, with Sparta turning into “Buffalo Bill’s Wild West Show”, or (God help us) “Medieval Times”, where Roman tourists could see the Spartans do their crazy Spartan stuff.

Alaric the Visigoth sacked Sparta in 396 CE. And until this trip I could not have told anyone a single thing that happened in the Peloponnese until the 20th Century (and that would have been limited to “I think I visited Olympia in 1981, as a child).

![Spectular landscapes everywhere!](images/landscape.jpg)

I knew nothing of [William II of Villehardouin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_II_of_Villehardouin) brought the Peloponnese into the [Frankish Principality of Achaea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principality_of_Achaea), nor how after 1259 CE it was the capital of the [Byzantine Despotate of the Morea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Despotate_of_the_Morea). 

I do know that every single village we walked through had a memorial to its sons and daughters who died in the Greek War of Independence. And I know that this region’s history was tied up with Greek, Roman, Frankish, Venetian, and Ottoman rulers for two thousand years, although I don’t know their names. So much to learn!

## Industrial Specialization

One cool thing we learned on our hike is the degree of industrial specialization distributed among the towns of central Arcadia.

Stemnitsa was a center of metal-work, from find-work like jewlery (there is still a school for jewlers in the town) to big stuff like church-bells. Neighboring Dimitsana, benefitting from the River Lousios, was a center for milling; there is a very cool Museum of Water-Power in the town, with working examples of different kinds of mills. Magouliana is the “Village of Wood-Cutters” and, up the road, Valtesiniko is the “Village of Wood-Workers.” Lagadia is the “Village of Stone-Workers.”

Dimitsana milled grain and pressed olives for oil, but if you are good at milling you can also mill gunpowder. With Stemnitsa providing locks and barrels for muskets, Dimitsana providing powder, and Valtetsiniko providing the “furniture” (the stock), central Arcadia was the “Arsenal of Greek Independence.”
