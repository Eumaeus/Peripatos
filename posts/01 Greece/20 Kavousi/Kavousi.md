# Kavousi: A Love Story

![Kavousi](images/Kavousi_from_Kastro_IMG_4328.jpeg)

In a nation of tiny towns, Kavousi is on the tinier side. Its population has hovered around the 600 level for decades. It's big enough to have two tavernas on the main road, but the grocery store situation was and is marginal. There's no hotel, though one taverna will rent out the five rooms on its second floor.

And yet Kavousi has played an outsize role in our lives. How can this be?

It's all thanks to archaeology.

## Kavousi 1990

*Raiders of the Lost Ark* has been one of my favorite movies ever since Stephen Berry's mom, Betty Berry, took him, me, and my brother to see it in the theatre. Archaeology! How exciting!

When I got to Duke, I thought I would finally have the chance to study archaeology. It would be just like Indiana Jones's class at Stanford, or whatever university he's meant to be teaching at, though I never could make out exactly what he was talking about in the lecture scene. Anyway, Duke! It's a university! Surely there would be archaeology!

![Duke chapel, same as it ever was.](images/Duke_Chapel_IMG_4560.jpg)

Well, yes and no. What I didn't know is that not every university has all the things, and most class offerings are highly dependent on what the given professors feel like teaching at any given moment. And it's not the easiest thing in the world to even figure out what department would teach archaeology. Egyptian stuff? Not at Duke. (Maybe in Religion?) Dinosaur bones? Likewise. (Geology?) Anthropology didn't have much in the Indiana Jones line, though they did have some solid physical anthropology offerings on hominids, and I did enjoy my classes at the lemur center. 

But I have my modest store of student-craft, so I did what one does in these situations: I asked my classics-major boyfriend what he thought. (This was shortly before I met Chris….) He suggested that I take John Younger's Aegean Bronze Age class. So I did.

This class was great! It was all about Crete, plus Mycenae. And Thira, before Santorini was a thing. Maybe some other Aegean islands, I can't remember. 

We studied all the [major sites in Crete](http://www.minoancrete.com/index.html)--Knossos, Kato Zakros, Phaestos. For my project, I searched the Linear B records for references to bull leaping. (My findings: the Linear B records say nothing whatsoever about bull leaping because they are just inventories of pots and such, though bovids are mentioned in a few lists.) The next semester, Younger set me up with an independent study reading through Sir Arthur Evans' diaries from the excavations at Knossos. I loved me some Crete!

So it was a no-brainer for me to ask him if he could get me onto a dig the summer after I finished study abroad in Paris. No problem, he said, and sent me to Kavousi.

### Eastern Crete

Getting to eastern Crete in June, 1990, wasn't quick or easy. Here's what I did:

1. I took a charter flight from Orly airport to Athens. Charter flights aren't scheduled until a day or two before departure. This one ended up leaving in the afternoon, putting me in Athens at the same moment that the overnight ferry departed to Heraklion from Piraeus. I was supposed to turn up in Kavousi the next day, so this was a problem.

1. I walked from the international terminal to the domestic terminal and bought the cheapest ticket to Heraklion--$50, leaving at 5 a.m. Athens airport looked like a bus station in those days. I checked in my bags for the flight.

1. I took a city bus into town and got off at Syntagma. I spent the evening wandering around the National Gardens and the lower slopes of the Acropolis--only the top was enclosed in those days.

1. After it got dark, I took the bus back to the airport and spent the rest of the night sitting there. I befriended a young German woman who was on the same flight; she was going to meet her Cretan boyfriend.

1. We boarded before dawn and landed in Heraklion as the sun came up. Heraklion airport looked even more like a bus station than Athens airport.

1. I took a city bus to the eastern Crete bus terminal.

1. I boarded another bus for the two-hour drive to [Pacheia Ammos](https://www.crete-today.com/pachia-ammos/), where the dig personnel were assembling and where most of them were staying. I had no idea the drive would take two hours, though, so I kept setting my alarm in ten-minute increments so I wouldn't sleep through my stop. 

1. In Pacheia Ammos, I learned that I'd be staying in Kavousi itself. A few us us drove the 15 minutes further east to our summer home, and I moved into my room around noon.

That was a long trip. 

![The road into Kavousi](images/Road_into_Kavousi_IMG_4226.jpg)

### The town

So, Kavousi. Today, Kavousi is a very small town located on the Lasithi plateau about half an hour east of Agios Nikolaus. The permanent population is about 600. That hasn't changed much since 1990. 

But Kavousi has been inhabited for millenia. Kavousi itself is situated in a lovely area, with access to both mountains and the sea. The main highway still runs through it, evidence that it's at an ideal crossroads location. The name "Kavousi" is a Cretan dialect word for "water source," suggesting that this might have been a reason to settle here.

Someone planted an olive tree there a very long time ago. Minoans? 

![This olive tree is said to be 3,400 years old!](images/Kavousi_olive_tree_IMG_9665.jpg)

In 1990, the town was just beginning to modernize. There was electricity, but no air conditioning. I shared a room that had two twin beds with another girl. We had a bathroom, but you couldn't put toilet paper in the toilet. (It took my roommate a few days to believe this.) There was no storage, so we kept our things under our beds. 

![My roommate and I had the center room facing the street.](images/Kavousi_taverna_rooms_IMG_9486.jpg)

The one-room "grocery store" sold an odd assortment of things--eggs, koulouri, eastern European nutella knockoffs.

![A few old people still lived in literal hovels on this street.](images/Kavousi_street_painter_IMG_9482.jpg)

### The Kastro

![The site on the Kastro](images/Kastro_site_IMG_9618.jpg)

The [Kastro](https://instapstudycenter.net/archaeological-projects/ascsa-projects/kastro/) site, perched on a mountain peak, was founded around 1,200 BCE. It's a bit younger than the lower Vronda site, where most of the dig was concentrated. The name "Kastro" means "castle," though there's nothing about the Kastro that would remind anyone of an actual castle. It's just [a few "houses" stuck on top of a mountain](https://www.ascsa.edu.gr/uploads/media/hesperia/147919.pdf), and they were not nice houses. 

The Kastro itself would have been a rough place to live. The views are amazing, to be sure, but living up there would have been … hard. There's no obvious spring nearby. The east side is at the top of a gorge. I can't imagine having babies up there. They would just toddle right off the edge.

But the Kastro was inhabited from 1,200 until the late 7th century BCE. That's a good five hundred years. The people who lived up there must have had a good reason to put themselves to such inconvenience and danger. Pirates, say historians. Better to live on a waterless mountaintop than have your children snatched from their beds at night….

### Getting to work

![The Kastro is up there.](images/Kavousi_Kastro_view_from_town_IMG_9668.jpg)

Dig days started early. My alarm went off at 5:25. I'd put in my contacts, don my work clothes, and eat a tiny breakfast of two [McVities Digestive Biscuits](https://www.englishteastore.com/products/mcvities-dark-chocolate-digestives-300g) spread with either Nutella or a low-rent Greek knockoff; it tasted the same, but always had half an inch of oil sitting on top of the chocolate spread.

![McVities Digestive Biscuits, still popular today!](images/McVities_IMG_4387.jpg)

Those of us staying in Kavousi itself had it easy--we strolled down to the Pharangi taverna and boarded the pickup trucks at 5:50. The rest of the team had to get up and out early enough to catch the bus to Kavousi first. (Or maybe the trucks picked them up? I don't remember. Maybe the bus didn't run that early.)

It was dark. That summer I discovered the procession of the stars across the heavens. I'd never before noticed that the moon rises noticeably later every day, or that the stars are in a slightly different place every morning--the moon is easy to see, but the movement of the stars is only apparent if you watch the sky from the same place for several weeks.

We sat on two-by-fours in the backs of pickup trucks. That's always been one of my favorite modes of travel in hot, dry places like summer camp in West Texas. In un-air-conditioned eastern Crete, it was the only time we felt a breeze. 

We drove up the dirt road next at the western end of Kavousi, winding among the olive groves and bouncing on the rocks. It took about 20 minutes to reach the lower site, Vronda, where most of the crew disembarked. 

![This area is riddled with ancient sites.](images/kavousi_trail_signs2.jpg)

The Kavousi team kept on going to the little dirt cutout under a sheer cliff face where it was possible to turn around and park two trucks. There, we got out and started climbing.

To reach the Kastro, we hiked up an old "cobbled Turkish road" called a *kalderimi*. 

A cobbled road--what does that mean? It means a trail, but one that's been enhanced with rocks and that at least used to be maintained. It was narrow, rocky, and twisty, and some bits were steep. 

![The *kalderimi*, an old cobbled path.](images/Kalderini_IMG_4262.jpg)

Two older men met us at the trailhead, having walked up from Kavousi with donkeys. These donkeys carried some water up, but they were mainly there to transport our potsherds back down. The men murmured endearments to their donkeys all the way up and down.

Up and up we went, everyone generally walking alone with their pre-dawn thoughts.

![At its top, the path to the kastro crosses a little pass to get to the east side of the mountain.](images/Pass_to_gorge_side_IMG_9590.jpg)

![This was our destination: the Kastro.](images/Kastro_site_IMG_9618.jpg)

![There was a gorge off to one side.](images/Kastro_gorge_IMG_4339.jpg)

I recall it taking us about 30 minutes to climb from the parking area to the Kastro; more recent experience suggests that it must have been closer to 45 minutes. And not everyone was young! 

That was a wonderful way to start every day. The Mediterranean was always visible off to the north. Sunrise gradually got later and later over the course of the summer, until we were doing almost the entire walk in the pre-dawn dusk, and the sun appeared over the tops of the peaks to the east as we rounded the bend to the gorge that lay to the east of the Kastro.

![The hills rang with the distant clangs of goat bells.](images/goat_bells_740.mov)

### A day on a dig

![The view from the top](images/Kastro_view_from_top_IMG_4301.jpg)

Having arrived at our mountaintop worksite, everyone took a moment to collect themselves. The veterans all had [frappé shakers](https://alaellinika.com/product/shaker-for-greek-frappe/?srsltid=AfmBOorCUqHAlR5HQ3pF54YccM58HbMRlvtSVO2m1TZMrUCPWsbG9miZFvE) so they could make themselves instant Nescafe. [Bill Coulson](https://www.archaeological.org/endowment/william-d-e-coulson-memorial-lectureship/) always started the day with a shot of raki, which he would generously share with me. It's not a habit I've maintained, but it did wake me up. 

Each grad student or professor was in charge of their own portion of the dig, which amounted to each person excavating their own house. Everyone had a trench assistant. I was one of those. 

At the start of the dig, I hadn't been assigned a trench, so [Donald Haggis](https://classics.unc.edu/people-3/faculty-2-2/donald-c-haggis/) took me on as an extra assistant; he was already working with a young Greek woman. He was [excavating a house](https://www.ascsa.edu.gr/uploads/media/hesperia/148436.pdf) on the west side of the main peak. He was also doing a bigger project, a field survey of this part of eastern Crete. 

![Donald Haggis and me in his trench.](images/Amy_Donald_Kastro_img119.jpg)

The work was kind of meditative. (Not to say boring….) We slowly and painstakingly chipped the dirt off the rocks that had formed the base of the walls of houses. We made great use of whisk brooms, sweeping the dust off the dirt. The trick was to find a "floor," which was difficult, given that any floor would be made of the same dirt we'd just dug off it.

As we dug, we'd turn up bits of long-broken pottery. These all went into collecting buckets. 

Donald taught me how to make measured drawings using a string and a tape measure. I enjoyed making those. He also showed me how to use the surveying telescope for taking elevations. 

![The west wing of the Kastro settlement.](images/Kastro_west_side_IMG_4311.jpg)

Jennifer Tobin arrived a couple of weeks into the season, and I moved over to her trench on the northeast corner of the site. 

![This trench was a potsherd mecca!](images/Jennifer's_%20trench_IMG_9594.jpg)

The point of all this activity was to get a [good overview of the settlement](https://www.ascsa.edu.gr/uploads/media/hesperia/148394.pdf) and its history. (All results described in the linked publications. I myself am no expert on this field!)

At 10:30, the dig leaders would call "Kolazo!" That was the signal for our lunch (breakfast?) break. We'd sit down in the odd patches of shade with our Laughing Cow cheese, crackers, boiled eggs, and whatever other foodstuffs we'd managed to find that would survive the walk up the hill. Canned tuna with peas mixed in was a popular discovery.

As the summer wore on, I befriended several of the local workers, and my lunches got immeasurably better. A 12-year-old boy who'd landed a job (at union rates!) always had a great pile of containers of food furnished by his mother--bread, mizithra, kalamari. He would say to me: "Amy! Eat! Kalamari!" And I did.

After lunch, we'd work for another couple of hours. Around 1:30, the workers would load up the donkeys with the day's finds, and we'd head back down the kalderimi path to the trucks. This walk always went faster than the walk uphill. We'd pile back into the trucks, stop at Vronda to pick up the rest of the dig staff, and drive down to the Apothiki.

It never once rained. Not once, all summer. My nose was always full of dust.

![No plants up there that summer!](images/Kastro_working_scan0008.jpg)

### Apothiki afternoons

![The apothiki.](images/Apothiki_IMG_9538.jpg)

The whitewashed apothiki at the top of town was the dig's workshop. This was where we sorted our pottery, redid drawings using the light table, and … I don't know what else. Mainly we sorted pottery.

Kavousi's residents apparently loved dig time because they made bank. While most of the guys were up on the dig doing heavy manual labor, the town's women got jobs washing pottery. They'd spend part of the day sitting at the apothiki, scrubbing dirt off potsherds with toothbrushes. They were instructed to work gently, so as not to scrub off paint or clay as well, but this did not always happen. It was even rumored that when the bristles wore completely off the brushes, they'd simply turn them over and scrub with the back sides.

Every trench had its own table made of trestles and plywood set out under the trees. When the ladies were done washing the potsherds, they'd spread them on the respective tables to dry in the sun. The previous day's pottery was always still slightly damp when we arrived. 

First thing, everyone would put in a drink order, and someone would bring up heaps of cold cans from the Pharangi taverna. I started the summer drinking Coke, but soon switched to Limonata and club soda. We were so thirsty, and the club soda had a bit of salt in it that seemed to help with my nighttime leg cramps.

We could never drink enough.

The apothiki also had the only toilet we encountered during the workday. (Most days on the Kastro, I just never went. It was so dry. If anyone did need to go, they had to pick their way around the high side of the gorge and find a convenient rock or bush.) It had a bucket flush system--you filled a bucket from a hose and dumped it into the toilet to flush.

We spent the afternoon sorting our broken bits of pottery into categories--edges, handles, bases, spouts, body pieces. Anything with paint got special attention. We'd try to fit pieces together, but that was mostly a fool's errand after 3000 years. It was easiest with potsherd's we'd accidently broken ourselves.

I'm told that the junky pottery got dumped into a well at the end of the season.

### Evening: the Pharangi taverna

![The sign at the Pharangi, named for the gorge across the street. It was owned by the Douloumi family.](images/Kavousi_Pharangi_sign_IMG_9488.jpg)

At 5, we were done. We walked down the steep, grooved pavement though the town and crossed the street to our rooms. We showered. I'd wash my dig clothes at the same time. Showers were supposed to be short to conserve water, and some of us observed that we always finished our showers with a lingering coat of dirt on our skins that came off on the towels. We hung our clothes to dry on the clothesline on the balcony, and then walked down to the Pharangi.

![Imagine this patio full of tables.](images/Kavousi_Pharangi_IMG_9489.jpg)

I never knew why we always went there. There was a perfectly good taverna under our rooms, and we did eat there once or twice, but the Pharangi was the social nexus of the dig. 

Manolis Douloumi was in his early 20s at the time, and he was the master of the establishment during his summer breaks from the University of Thessaloniki. He was always so friendly and happy to see us. 

![Manolis only came up the mountain once that summer, for the end-of-dig party. Usually, he had to work in the taverna. That's him on the right, in the blue plaid shirt.](images/Amy_Manolis_party_Kastro_img120.jpg)

The food there was simple, but it tasted so good. The chicken tasted like the herbs everywhere on the hillsides. Manolis says the french fries were so delicious because he fried them all in his family's olive oil. My favorite meal was kalamari and horiatiki.

We helped ourselves to soft drinks from the fridge. Wine came in little pitchers filled from a barrel of the Douloumi family's wine. 

And oh, it was cheap! The whole summer cost maybe a thousand dollars, including room and occasional bus rides.

The Pharangi was where we received and made phone calls. I gave my parents the number and told them the times I was likely to be around, and they would call me once a week or so. It was MUCH easier to have them call me than to call out, which involved multiple numbers and a calling card, and mostly just didn't work anyway.

### Entertainment

There was not much to do in Kavousi. The TV at the Pharangi played Greek television, mostly the World Cup or politics. No one had computers or cell phones in those days! 

Kids today might find this hard to believe, but we managed to entertain ourselves. We read a lot. Favorite novels were passed around based on an informal waiting list. The copy of a Clive Cussler novel involving a sexy lady archaeologist was especially popular. (I just did a little searching, and I have identified this book as *Treasure,* published in 1988. It begins with the sexy lady archaeologist working in Greenland, where her parka conceals the size of her assets. She and Dirk Pitt then proceed to travel effectively everywhere in search of the lost Library of Alexandria.)

I read my first Robertson Davies novel, *The Rebel Angels*, which rocked my world and had a lot to do with the path that I followed immediately thereafter. I wanted to be the character Maria--so sophisticated and cosmopolitan and exotic and multilingual, and all her professors were in love with her! That book performed the minor miracle of making humanities grad school sound sexy. I read the notorious pink ribbon scene on the Sunday that a worldly grad student took me to the famous (notorious?) Vai Beach, land of nude Germans. 

Some nights we played poker for drachmas. That was fun. Someone must have had a tape deck; Eric Clapton's *Timepieces* and Van Morrison's *Moondance* were sounds of the summer and the cds I bought the instant I got back home. 

Every Tuesday and Friday afternoon, we were excused from apothiki duty. This gave us time to catch the bus into Agio Nikolaus or Ierapetra to visit a proper grocery store or ATM and grab a restaurant meal. Ag Nik had a Chinese restaurant that was especially popular.

Some Saturday mornings we worked at the apothiki. Those weekends, it was impossible to go anywhere substantial; it took two full hours to get to Heraklion on the bus, and we had to be back in Kavousi by Sunday evening. But we could still spend Sunday at the beach in [Ierapetra](https://www.discovergreece.com/crete/ierapetra) or [Agios Nikolaus](https://www.cretetravel.com/en/guide/17/Agios_Nikolaos). 

Ierapetra was especially beautiful, with its view south over the Libyan Sea and its wooden platforms out in the water, though you had to avoid stepping on the sea urchins. It was a lovely place to while away an afternoon drinking frappés under a taverna shade.

![Ierapetra is on the south coast, overlooking the Libyan Sea.](images/Ierapetra_IMG_4374.jpg)

My first time in Ierapetra, I bought a pair of leather flip flops that were some of the best shoes I've ever had. I wore them all summer and kept them in my closet in Baton Rouge as pool shoes for years after.

Every other Saturday we had off. If we left Friday afternoon, we could actually go places. One weekend, I went off with the assistant paleobotanist and two other trench assistants for a trip all the way to Chania, at the western end of Crete. (The actual paleobotanist never showed up that summer, so the assistant was in charge of water seiving all the dirt specimens for ancient seeds or whatever.) The assistant paleobotanist gave me his walkman so I could listen to this great new band called They Might Be Giants as the bus drove west into the mountains near Ag Nik. We had to stay in Heraklion on Friday night because the bus got there too late for us to continue on. I ran into my Duke prof John Younger, who was drinking ouzo in the town square. Small world. 

![Chania looked then exactly like it does now, except with about one one-thousandth the number of tourists. I bought a couple of traditional Cretan knives there.](images/Chania_IMG_3409.MOV)

I tried going to the beach on the north coast a few times, but it was invariably disappointing. The beach at Sitia was about 2 meters wide, which seemed pointless, and the water in Agios Nikolaus was full of potato chip bags. 

![Sitia does have a pretty harbor, though.](images/Sitea_harbor_IMG_4397.MOV)

One weekend, I went to Heraklion by myself to visit [Knossos](https://knossos-palace.gr/?tm=tt&ap=gads&aaid=adammXapZvTAX&gad_source=1&gbraid=0AAAAApg46RV-oVGUi_j7z0Uwm71Vj89Om&gclid=CjwKCAjw-qi_BhBxEiwAkxvbkHvH13GLdZ3WSTYnozyhClCYO8dA5hOYys1vEYKvCzZmpY0xnaVk_RoC1uAQAvD_BwE). I'm glad I did, because it was possible to actually see the place in those days, without today's hordes of tourists. I doubt I'll ever go there now.

### End of summer

![Archaeologists gone wild!](images/Peggy_Kastro_party_img121.jpg)

I left Kavousi in early August and made my slow and deliberate way back to Baton Rouge. The slowness was the result of silly decisions. Back in Paris, I'd bought a round-trip ticket between Paris and Athens from a charter company. These tickets were for specific dates, but you couldn't find out what time they left until three days ahead of time. I was returning to Paris because I had a round-trip, open-ended student ticket between the US and Paris--one of those tickets that you couldn't schedule more than 72-hours in advance, based on space available.

It was years later that it occurred to me that we could've saved a lot of trouble and money if I'd just bought a one-way ticket to Greece and then just flown straight home from there. 

As things turned out, Duke called my parents and said I'd been made an RA. I had to turn up for training on a specific date in August. This meant scheduling a flight like a responsible adult with a job. So I had my dad buy me a ticket home from Paris the day after I was supposed to return from Greece.

To learn what time my flight to Paris would depart, I had to call the French charter company. This proved impossible to do with the Pharangi's telephone. I basically had to go to Athens to make a phone call. 

This time I took the overnight ferry, deck class as we students did. Never again! No matter how hot the summer, spending a night in the wind on the deck of a sailing ship is freezing. Also, a bench is not comfortable to sleep on.

In Athens, I spent three nights in a nice hotel near Kolonaki Square and the American School. That remains one of my favorite parts of Athens. I visited the Acropolis, the archaeology museum, and the Kolonaki Museum, where I bought a great pair of earrings and a book of embroidery patterns. I took two baths a day.

![As a perk of the dig job, we got museum passes that let us visit museums and sites for free.](images/Museum_pass_IMG_4999.jpg)

I made it back to Paris and thence Baton Rouge, of course. Three days later, I drove up to Durham. The next week, I attended a photo lecture by John Younger, who was sharing the story of his own summer in Crete. 

There, I met a new classics grad student named Chris Blackwell. He invited me to see *Fantasia* with him. He wore an Atlanta Braves baseball cap held together with duct tape, he drove a pickup truck, and he'd read Robertson Davies, too.

## Kavousi 2023

Kavousi was much on my mind in the first year I knew Chris. He heard all about how I'd spent the summer working on an archaeological dig on top of a mountain. 

Thirty-three years went by. I always thought it would be fun to show Chris where I'd spent the months right before I met him, but there were so many other places we had to go, journeying to the remoter regions of Crete never bubbled up to the top of the list.

Then our friend George Coundoussias announced that his son, Demitri, would be getting married in Crete. And that gave us our excuse.

### Rethymno, May 5-7

![Demitri and Maggie, the reason we came to Rethymno.](images/Rethymno_brideandgroom_IMG_9440.jpg)

George is from [Gavalou](), but Demitri's wedding took place in Rethymno, in western Crete. Crete might be part of the nation-state of Greece, but it is physically and culturally distant from the mainland. This was just as much a destination wedding for George's Greek relatives as it was for the rest of us.

This time, we sailed to Crete on the overnight ferry. We'd flown into Athens the day before so Chris could meet with Greek collaborators. We spent a day discovering that Athens had indeed become impossibly overtouristed, or at least the Acropolis had, and Kolonaki Square was under construction. We were happy to head to Piraeus to board our ferry as soon as it opened at 6 pm. 

No deck class for us this time--we sprang for a double cabin, which ensured both a comfortable night's sleep and considerable deference from the stewards. In the morning, they greeted us with broad smiles before turning to kick awake the deck class passengers bunked down in sleeping bags in the snack bar and under stairwells.

![We cruised into the Heraklion harbor at dawn on a drizzly morning.](images/Crete_Dawn_arrival_Heraklion_IMG_9235.MOV)

I'd initially intended to take the bus to Rethymno, just like old times. But times have changed, and you can now hire a taxi to drive between cities. (Actually, you could in 1990, too; I just didn't spend money like that.) For €100, we could be in Rethymno in less than an hour. 

The drive was familiar, and yet it wasn't. A portion of the hillside had collapsed at one point, reducing the coastal road to one lane. It drizzled the whole way--evidently it DOES rain in Crete!

![Rainy Rethymno](images/Rethymno_stormy_sea_IMG_9314.MOV)

We stayed at the [Rimondi Estate hotel](https://www.hotelbrain.com/hotels-in-crete/rimondi-hotels-rethymnon) in the Old Town. There are no cars allowed in the Old Town's warren of narrow streets, all of which seem to sell tourist schlock. This place must be impassible in high summer.

George hosted an indulgent rehearsal dinner at the lovely seaside restaurant [Paraplous](https://www.paraplous.gr/en/). It was so cold and windy! 

![We'd all packed for a balmy spring wedding!](images/Rethymno_rehearsal_IMG_9301.jpg)

The wedding itself was at a lovely place in the countryside called [Agreco Farms](https://www.agreco.gr) (you can buy their products at the Heraklion airport duty-free). The owners have really worked the agritourismo angle, creating a charming facility that someone still seems mostly genuine. 

![It was an extraordinarily beautiful wedding.](images/Rethymno_wedding_IMG_9436.jpg)

### To Kavousi, May 7

We could have taken the bus to Kavousi, but that would have taken all day. And we're not students anymore; we can exchange money for convenience if we feel like it!

In Rethymno, we'd basically hired a driver named Nectarios to take us to and from wedding activities. But Nectarios was a strictly local driver, so to get to Kavousi we needed someone with more scope. [Welcome Pickups](https://www.welcomepickups.com/crete/airport-taxi/?utm_campaign=15688138993&utm_source=g_c&utm_medium=cpc&utm_content=647354138043&utm_term=p_welcome%20pickups%20crete&gad_source=1&gbraid=0AAAAAoWHt0PAzNRuLSbBfz_wU2iJQjMJQ&gclid=CjwKCAjwwLO_BhB2EiwAx2e-3_BqoqgqDPdnTzfW4Qc9A954_WxGcvU_Je0FuT5iwE8tUJBAN0BxJhoCixQQAvD_BwE) hooked us up with Aristides Psarakis from Heraklion, who collected us in a minivan set up for family transport.

And how times have changed! It used to take the bus a good two hours just to go from Heraklion to Kavousi along the old coastal road. Now there's a fancy highway through the mountains and bypassing Agios Nikolaus. The total trip from Rethymno to Kavousi took under two hours, including a coffee break at a [Gregory's](https://corporate.gregorys.gr/en/istoria/) (Greek truck stop).

I'd found an [AirBnB](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/639751583607004884?source_impression_id=p3_1743089595_P32LtDudSXcI_lXZ) on a small whitewashed street draped in hot pink bouganvillea.

![Our street.](images/Kavousi_our_street_IMG_9535.jpg)

Kavousi is getting fancy, though, and our apartment had all the amenities (except for a washing machine) shoe-horned into an ancient stone and whitewash dwelling. Evidently it had belonged to our host's aunt and he'd done it up to rent to tourists.

It was Sunday, and we were worried about finding food, so the first thing we did was walk down to the main street. There we discovered a new coffee bar and bakery and a tiny grocery store selling fresh eggs and local sausages. Food anxiety alleviated, we ventured down the highway toward the Pharangi taverna. 

![Alas, the Pharangi is closed!](images/Kavousi_Pharangi_defunct_IMG_9490.jpg)

But a new establishment had opened next door, a cocktail and wine bar called Chez Georges. Our drinks came with a free snack of Japanese plums--the ripe fruit of the moment. 

![George and Amy](images/Chez_Georges_IMG_9676.jpg)

I showed George a couple of pictures from 1990. It turned out that he recognized Manolis. In fact, Manolis had been in town just the day before; he lives in Ierapetra and works as an accountant now. George immediately called Manolis, who agreed to meet us at Chez George the next night.

That evening, we dined at the taverna where I stayed back in 1990. It's now called Ndakos, after the traditional Cretan rusk salad, and run by an energetic young man. The menu is more extensive than it used to be, featuring several Cretan specialties, which is the fashion nowadays. The portions are HUGE, even by the already generous standards of Greek tavernas. We had more Japanese plums for dessert. 

The proprietor remembered the archaeologists who used to come to the village; he would have been a kid when I was there. Everyone in Kavousi remembers the digs! 

### May 8: Return to the Kastro!

I awoke to the smell of Chris frying the local sausages we'd bought the previous day. He boiled eggs, too, for us to carry up the mountain.

We walked uphill through the town past the old apothiki and onto the dirt trail leading through the olive fields. I had never walked this part of the path before. I knew it was possible to reach the Kastro on foot from Kavousi, but we always rode the trucks up to Vronda. 

![This is part of the E4 trail.](images/Kavousi_Start_of_trail_IMG_9511.jpg)

A little brown dog joined us. After she walked with us for about an hour, we realized that she was *de facto* our dog for the day. We named her Scylla.

![Scylla trots up the path.](images/Dog_path_to_Kastro_IMG_9578.jpg)

The kalderimi path seemed familiar and yet not. So much memory can disappear after 33 years, especially if you don't have any photographs of it and have lost contact with anyone who shared the experience. 

![Up and up we walked.](images/Kavousi_trail_up_Chris_IMG_9572.MOV) 

![The Kastro is up there.](images/Kavousi_trail_Kastro_Up_There_IMG_9657.jpg)

The last part of the path is fairly exposed, dusty, and narrow. It actually frightened me to walk on it; that was surprising, as was my sense of vertigo walking around parts of the site itself. Fear of heights was not something that ever occurred to me when I was younger. 

![Maybe I've just grown cowardly with age, but there's an edge right there!](images/Edge_right_there_IMG_9632.jpg)

![After 33 years, I'm back at my old workplace!](images/Kavousi_back_to_Kastro_IMG_9592.MOV)

![Chris observed, "When you said you climbed a mountain every day, I had no idea that this is what you meant!"](images/Kavousi_Chris_arrives_Kastro_IMG_9593.MOV) 

![The informational sign describing the site.](images/Kastro_site_sign_IMG_4329.jpg)

One of the 1990 dig organizers had advised everyone to wear long pants due to the many spiky plants in Crete. Most of us younger workers disregarded that advice, and I never noticed that the landscape was especially spiky. That was probably because the path and the site itself were so heavily traveled in those days, which trampled down the spines. Today, the spiky plants were very much in evidence. The place was overgrown with thistles that stuck right through my shoes.

![Back in 1990, there were no plants whatsoever up here.](images/Kastro_site_IMG_9618.jpg)

![The place was awash in spring wildflowers. I picked my mom a Mother's Day bouquet.](images/Flowers_IMG_9624.jpg)

Another thing that's different is that the site was "restored" in the mid-90s, after the excavation was complete. The walls are actual walls now, much higher than they used to be. 

![I had to climb over walls to get into Donald's old trench.](images/Kastro_my_first_trench_IMG_9596.jpg)

It was nice to be back up there. I'd always remembered the Kastro as a beautiful place, with stunning views all around. I was glad to see that I'd remembered it correctly. I sat on the wall of my old trench and peeled hard-boiled eggs to feed the dog. She liked the yolks, and enjoyed crunching up the shells. I ate the whites. 

![Chris gave the dog some water.](images/Kavousi_dog_water_IMG_9611.MOV)

Chris tried to fly his drone, but the wind was fierce, and Scylla nearly lost her mind barking at the buzzing thing. Chris feared she might follow it over a cliff edge, so he pulled it in.

![Scylla says this is a No-Drone Zone!](images/Kavousi_drone_dog_IMG_9607.MOV)

We'd intended to walk back down to Kavousi via the gorge path, where I'd never been before--it's astonishing how much I didn't learn about Kavousi in an entire summer living there! Two things changed our minds. One, we weren't sure Scylla would find her way back home if we didn't retrace our steps. Two, as we crested the pass to the Kastro, we encountered a mountain guide walking in the opposite direction, from the gorge. He said the trail was "a little exposed." "A little exposed" is mountain-guide language for "terrifying narrow broken trail along a deadly sheer cliff-face".

So we simply reversed our steps, taking the path I'd walked at the end of every workday that summer. That was the right way to do this day, anyway.

![Chris descending from the Kastro.](images/Kastro_path_down_Chris_IMG_9647.MOV)

### Meeting an old friend

At sunset, we walked back down the hill to Chez Georges. Manolis arrived to meet us, and we spent a lovely evening together. 

![We hadn't changed a bit!](images/Kavousi_Manolis_Amy_IMG_9673.jpg)

Though our worries about finding food the previous day had come to nothing, tonight there was in fact nowhere to eat in Kavousi. Chez Georges is just a wine and cocktail bar, but George does serve snacks in addition to drinks and Japanese plums. He also sells local honey and large sacks of dried up bread. Chris asked what those things were.

Manolis explained that in the past, Cretans baked bread just once a year. They dried it rock hard for storage (not hard in such a dry climate) and used it to make a dish called Dakos (or ntakos). This is a dried-up rusk soaked with water and topped with chopped tomatoes and olive oil. Manolis had George make one and bring it to us.

![Our dinner: dakos and the inevitable Japanese plums!](images/Kavousi_Dakos_ChezGeorge_IMG_9670.jpg)

Elections were coming up, and the taverna saw a steady stream of visitors from various parties, communists and conservatives greeting one another in a friendly manner while they handed out political fliers.

I asked Manolis whether the locals had liked or hated all the young American archaeologists who used to take over the town in the summers. I'd worried that we were a pain in the butt, rich and entitled. Manolis said no, it was great. The dig paid construction union wages, which brought in more income than locals could ever earn on their own, and it was fun. We must not have been so bad.

### May 9: Back to Heraklion

Manolis had wanted to arrange a visit for us at INSTAP, the research center for eastern Crete archaeology. Alas, we had to leave Kavousi. We'd arranged for Aristidis to come collect us and bring us back to Heraklion. Evidently, it's normal for Greek taxi drivers to invest an hour or more of driving to pick up a fare. The taxi service is convenient, but it does add up, which is one reason we mostly rented cars the following year.

I tried to persuade Chris that we needed to visit Knossos, but he refused. Instead, we toured the rather excellent [Museum of Greek Technology](https://kotsanasmuseum.com/our-museum-in-crete/?lang=en) and had a nice seafood lunch. The next day, we flew to Athens and started our [Ancient Paths](https://trekking.gr/en/excursions/delphi-6-days-ancient-hike-trail) hike, and that's another story.

![Tasty fish!](images/Heraklion_fish_IMG_9682.jpg)

## Kavousi 2024: October 22-27

![Kavousi at sunrise](images/Kavous_dawn_IMG_4453.jpg)

The last week of Chris' sabbatical trip was the perfect opportunity to return to Kavousi, where we could catch up on work and explore eastern Crete. This was the first time we could live in Kavousi as modern adults--with a car, and a kitchen, and jobs.

### Tuesday, October 22

We started the day in Chania, enjoying our nice hotel and its strong hot shower. After breakfast on the balcony overlooking the old town, we picked up our rented VW Polo (€259 for a week--not bad). 

![Our fun blue Polo parked by our house in Kavousi!](images/Polo_IMG_4222.jpg)

We drove out of Chania onto to the Ethniki Odo, heading east toward Heraklion and thence Kavousi. We passed countless beach resorts built on the south side of the highway; tourist wanting to visit the beach have to race across this busy road, surely an enticing proposition for families with kids or old people.

The driver who took us from Rethymno to Chania two weeks earlier had told us that this stretch of road is the most dangerous in Greece (or maybe Europe?). Thank the hordes of tourists in rental cars mixed with the drunk and the impatient. On a weekday morning, though, it wasn't so bad. 

The coast east of Heraklion is now entirely built up with vacation resorts and villas. But the road up to Agios Nikolaus is four-laned and new, and new sections were being built through the mountains as we drove through.

East of Agios Nikolaus, the road narrows down to the old two-lane highway. We rounded Mirabello Bay, passed Pacheia Ammos and the turn-off for Ierapetra, and then we were in Kavousi.

Our AirBnB hosts had given us detailed albeit baffling directions for how to reach the house. This involved driving up the road toward the Kastro and then veering off to the right, steeply up and down a gully, rounding a church, and then arriving at the parking lot next to the old apothiki. Their directions actually said, "You will think you are on the wrong path, but keep going!" 

![You turn here.](images/Road_to_sites_IMG_9494.jpg)

The road also comes to the house from the other direction, but I'm not sure that way isn't actually too steep for a car. 

![The road through Kavousi is steep!](images/Steep_walk_to_house_IMG_4220.MOV)

This house was the apotheosis of all our Greek rentals. A labor of love, it is huge and beautiful and filled with archaeological treatises in English, French, German, and Greek. The owner knows the people at INSTAP, the center for study of eastern Crete, and often rents the house to my old friend Donald Haggis when he comes to stay in the summers. She picks and chooses her tenants, and doesn't rent the house often. We were lucky that it was free and that she let us stay there!

![The stairs up to the living room and kitchen](images/Stone-house_stairs_IMG_4451.jpg)

![Looking toward the kitchen](images/Stone_house_kitchen_IMG_4191.jpg)

As always when arriving, I jumped right on to our first load of laundry.

![Our dryer.](images/Stone_house_dryer_IMG_4452.jpg)

We walked down to check out the "big" grocery store, which is not exactly big but is larger than many Greek "supermarkets." They at least had the makings of a horiatiki and sparkling waters. We had a car, so we could shop in bigger towns. 

![Anything we bought there, we had to carry up this slope!](images/Vertical_road_to_house_IMG_4219.jpg)

That evening, we strolled down the hill back to Chez Georges for an aperitif and then had dinner at Ntakos. The proprietor there remembered us from last year. He brought out the old reception book from the early 90s. Some of my dig people were in there from 1990, but I'd never signed in personally so there was no trace of my presence. 

### Wednesday, October 23: Tholos Beach and Agios Nikolaus

![Our view at breakfast](images/Kavous_dawn_IMG_4453.jpg)

We had breakfast on our beautiful balcony overlooking Kavousi and Mirabello Bay. Georges had given us a large jar of local honey for free. It was so good on yogurt!

Last year, Chris had suggested that we do a "mountain to the sea" hike to simulate life on a Minoan mountaintop settlement. You can see the ocean from the Kastro, and surely people would've made occasional trips down there to fish and have beach parties. Fear of pirates or not, they were Greeks! (Hm. Actually, they weren't. But they were Mediterranean, so surely they loved to have barbecues and relax by the ocean.) 

The hardcore way to do this would be to start at the Kastro, walk all the way down to Tholos beach, eat some fish there and maybe cavort about like Nausicaa and her girlfriends doing laundry, and then return to the Kastro. Ideally all on the same day. Even more ideally, having slept on the Kastro the night before.

That would obviously never work. No money would persuade me to spend a night in a tent on the Kastro just so we could start our journey there. Also, any hike that passed through town in both directions would surely end at that point because we would just go home. 

But life is full of compromises! We agreed that we could do this research journey on two separate days, both of which would start and end in the comfort of our house in Kavousi. Today we took the low road and walked to the beach.

![The road to Tholos passes through acres of olive orchards.](images/Tholos_road_olives_IMG_4217.MOV)

Though the road to Tholos is basically flat and has almost no traffic, and it's really not that far, it was surprisingly tiring. It takes a solid 45 minutes to reach the water. In 1990, some of us had walked down there once or twice to go to the beach, but it was too far to be a relaxing outing. We found that it didn't feel any closer now.

![Now there's a little taverna there.](images/Tholos_taverna_IMG_4205.jpg)

![Back at my old beach?](images/Tholos_beach_Amy_IMG_3702.jpg)

![The waves are gentle and I recall the water being quite warm, though I didn't get in this time.](images/Tholos_IMG_4213.MOV)

![Walking back to Kavousi is ever so slightly uphill.](images/Tholos_road_back_to_kavousi_IMG_4218.jpg)

In need of real groceries, we spent the afternoon in the big city of Agios Nikolaus. 

Now, I'd been to Ag Nik a number of times in 1990, always on the bus. All of us knew where to find the ATM, the good grocery store, the Chinese restaurant. 

I have never felt so unfamiliar with a place that I once knew well. I recognized nothing. The place is now packed with tourists, seemingly all from Germany. Even in late October. It's nothing but souvenir shops and streets lined with the same restaurants with the same touts outside.

We got ice creams at a shop by the famous inland lake, which I also didn't remember. Could it be that the beach where I tried to swim was on the lake? Who knows. For my ice cream, I got [kaimaki](https://www.kalofagas.ca/2022/10/26/kaimaki-ice-cream/), which is made with mastiha from Kos and salep--a very Turkish taste and texture.

That evening, we were joined by an orange and white cat who appeared on our balcony and made herself at home.

![Our cat.](images/Amy_cat_2.jpg)

### Thursday, October 24: Kastro and Ierapetra

It was time to revisit the Kastro. The trail was as hard as we remembered from last year! 

![That trail just goes up!](images/Kalderini_DJI_20241024161626_0005_D.MP4)

Chris got some great drone videos from the top.

![The site looks so much bigger when you can see it from above.](images/Kastro_overview_DJI_20241024174259_0016_D.MP4)

This was the first time I'd ever gotten a good aerial view of the Kastro. Drones must be a game-changer for archaeologists. In the 1980s, the only way to get aerial shots was to hire a hot-air balloon, of all things. 

That evening, we met Manolis for dinner in Ierapetra. We left early to take care of a special errand.

Our son was getting married in December. Before we left on our trip, my mother had suggested that I buy his fiancée, Biruja, a wedding veil in Greece. That sounded like a great idea! Greece and wedding veils just seem to go together--in my imagination, at least. As it happened, though, we'd traveled the length and breadth of the country and seen nary a wedding veil. Maybe if we'd been a big city, but wedding stores just didn't seem to be a thing anywhere we went.

This was our last week, so it was now or never. Some web searching revealed a couple of possibilities in eastern Crete--one in Heraklion, and one in Ierapetra!  

After some minor wandering, we found the shop: [Antzela](https://www.antzelaboutique.gr/en/). It's not a dedicated bridal shop, more a fancy ladies' clothing boutique.

The ladies running the place were somewhat taken aback by my request for a wedding veil, and even more when I said I wanted it then and there. But! The Greeks are a resourceful people. The owner remembered that they had a wedding veil sitting in a cabinet in the back. Her daughter excavated it and modeled it for us.

![This veil was perfect!](images/Wedding_veil_IMG_4377.jpg)

It was exactly what I wanted--just ankle length, simple but very Greek looking. 

Veil literally in the bag, we met Manolis for dinner at Cleio's, run by his friend Cleio. It was great to see him again. When I told him about the eroded state of the trail up to the Kastro, he lamented that the kalderini hasn't been maintained. Cutting dirt roads through it causes it to break down. 

Cleio gave us the customary free sweet after our meal. Her husband had made [Ypovrichio](https://www.thegreekvibe.com/ypovrichio-the-greek-submarine-spoon-sweet/), or submarines--spoons of a sweet paste flavored with mastic submerged in a glass of water. It's kind of like a chewy lollipop.

This is the second time in two days that I've mentioned mastic. Mastic, or [mastiha](https://www.amazon.com/Chios-Mastiha-Natural-Mastic-Growers/dp/B07Q454QLH?source=ps-sl-shoppingads-lpcontext&ref_=fplfs&psc=1&smid=A1FRTHPJ20XABI&gQT=1), is a solid plant resin from the mastic tree, *Pistacia lentiscus*. It comes from the island of [Chios](https://www.visitgreece.gr/islands/north-aegean-islands/chios/), which has made a living out of the stuff for thousands of years and still does today; everyone in Greece knows that [mastiha](https://www.slofoodgroup.com/products/chios-mastiha-mastic-gum?srsltid=AfmBOoqrKSKCap-0COV8JDHRfyWFeJX7fTT9_IkTgWu_-iy1yvjinD63) comes from Chios. It tastes kind of piney.

I like Ierapetra better than Agios Nikolaus. It seems more natural, less set up for tourism. Also, it's quicker to drive there from Kavousi.

![The sun going down in Ierapetra.](images/Ierapetra_sunset_IMG_4372.MOV)

### Friday, October 25: Cave of Zeus

![Starting the day with a nice breakfast!](images/Stone_house_balcony_IMG_4192.jpg)

The previous year, we were riding in a car climbing up the mountains high above the Gulf of Corinth when we happened to tell our driver, Demetrios, that we'd come from Crete. Crete! Oh, he had a video we must see!

Demetrios immediately diverted his attention from negotiating a winding mountain road next to a 500-foot drop-off into the ocean to searching through his phone for this video. It turned out that when he's not driving a car, he is a professional drummer. He'd participated in a traditional music performance in the Cave of Zeus (pronounced "Zefs"). Evidently Zeus was born on Crete and raised in this cave. We must see it when we returned to Crete!

Well, we were back in Crete, so maybe it was time to see this famous cave!

Why I thought it wouldn't be a massive tourist trap, I don't know. 

Anyway! We headed out toward Agios Nikolaus but then cut off into the mountains to the west. Up and up we wound. We stopped for coffee at a roadside stand/tourist souvenir shop, where the proprietor showed us a video of his resin woodworking technique and succeeded in persuading us that we needed to own some of his productions.

After some more driving in the remotest of mountains, we emerged onto the Lasithi plateau, famed for its old wood and cloth windmills. Does any serious farmer still use these things? Surely not. In late October, lots of the cloth had fallen to bits and was just handing in shreds on the wooden frames. I imagine they redo them at the start of tourist season in the spring.

![The Lassithi plateau; I didn't bother to take pictures of those fake windmills.](images/Lasithi_plateau_from_Psychro_IMG_4386.MOV)

The [Diktaean Cave](https://www.visitgreece.gr/experiences/nature/caves/diktaean-cave/) is located in the town of Psychro. The entrance is above a parking lot full of the usual tourist schlock. In the summer, the place must be mobbed with buses--you can book a tour of the whole Lasithi Plateau, which will take you to see the windmills too. 

On a gray weekday in late October, parking wasn't a big deal. Though it is possible that the parking lot was empty partly due to the fact that the cave was closed that day.

![Sorry, folks, park's closed!](images/Cave_of_Zeus_IMG_4384.jpg)

I should know by now always to check these things before setting out. 

For what it's worth, the Diktaean cave looks like it might be an interesting cave to visit, at least in the spelunking sense. Even though I'm not convinced that Zeus ever lived there. Like most sites in Crete, it's best enjoyed by the nimble and sure-footed. 

On the way home, we stopped at the Sklavenitis in Agios Nikolaus to buy Friskies for our balcony cat. 

![Our comfy living room. That night, inspired by a Halloween-season retrospective essay in the WSJ, we sat in there and watched *The Omen*.](images/Stone_house_living_room_IMG_4190.jpg)

### Saturday, October 26: Sitia and Kato Zakros

For our last Saturday in Greece, I wanted to show Chris a better time than I had the day before, with our fail-venture to the cave of Zefs. This time, we headed east.

The highway east of Kavousi looks much like it did in 1990. It's two lanes all the way, winding around the sides of mountains. If you end up behind a truck, you go that truck's speed until it leaves the road.

We stopped for coffee in the eastern town of Sitia. Sitia used to be famous for a pelican that hung around the harbor, but it's not there anymore. 

![Sitia's harbor](images/Sitia_clip_IMG_4397.MOV)

![One of many sailboats in Sitia.](images/Sitia_sailboat_IMG_4400.jpg)

The far eastern end of Crete isn't very developed or much visited. It takes some serious driving to get out here, which would discourage package tourists and even self-caterers.

Our objective was [Kato Zakros](https://www.cretetravel.com/en/guide/19/Kato_Zakros), where we could visit the Minoan site of [Zakros](http://www.minoancrete.com/zakros.htm) and the so-called [Gorge of the Dead](https://www.greeka.com/crete/lassithi/sightseeing/lassithi-gorge-of-the-dead/).

This [gorge](https://zakrospoliteia.gr/en/blog/articles/faraghghi-ton-nekrwn-zakros) is an interesting site. The E4 trail goes through it, from the hill village of Zakros all the way to the tiny town of Kato Zakros on the coast. 

![The Minoans used to bury people in caves on the gorge's sides.](images/Gorge_of_the_dead_IMG_4410.MOV) 

![Kato Zakros is on the far eastern coast, looking out toward Cyprus.](images/Kato_Zakros_lunch_IMG_4438.jpg)

![We drove back by way of the south coast. For anyone who enjoys driving on deserted, winding mountain roads, you can't do much better.](images/South_coast_drive_home_IMG_4449.jpg)

The south coast is getting more and more built up with tourist amenities, though many places still seem rough. 

We stopped at the Sklavenitis in Ierapetra on the road back to Pacheia Ammos. This is where we should shop from now on; it's closer than Ag Nik and much easier to get in and out of.

### Sunday, October 27: Kavousi

![Sunday morning dawned with church bells a'ringing.](images/Kavousi_Sunday_church_IMG_4456.jpg)

This was our last lazy Sunday in Greece. The time had changed overnight; daylight savings time had ended. (It would end again in the U.S. the following Sunday, which meant we were jet lagged for weeks.)

Over an entire summer of eating at the Pharangi taverna every day, I never once asked why the place was named "the canyon." This being our last opportunity to rectify my youthful ignorance, we walked out to see the famous gorge.

![Chris sitting at the mouth of the gorge.](images/Chris_gorge_drone_IMG_4463.jpg)

![We climbed partway up the trail.](images/Chris_gorge_IMG_4473.jpg)

![That gorge really is right next to Kavousi. Who knew!](images/Gorge_Chris_Kavousi_IMG_4471.jpg)

We had a last Sunday lunch at the local tavernas. There were a surprising number of tourists still hanging around at the tail end of October. 

![Last Fix Anef beer, but with lemon!](images/Kavousi_last_beer_IMG_4475.jpg)

### Monday, October 28: Homeward bound

We left the next day. It was just as well; another cat had started moving in, and we needed to nip that in the bud.

We'd planned to visit Knossos on the way to the airport, but it was mobbed with tourists. Like I said, I'm glad I saw it in 1990, because I doubt I ever will again.

## And then….

The wheel has come full circle, or something like that. 1990 evidently was a very important year for our family. So was 2024. 

Right after Chris and I flew back from Greece, we returned to Duke for our daughter's graduation.

![Duke chapel, this time with graduates of Duke nursing school!](images/Duke_graduation_IMG_4591.jpg)

Our son got married in New Orleans. The bride wore a wedding veil from Crete.

![All the most fashionable brides shop in Ierapetra.](images/Wedding_IMG_4787.jpg)

I've now seen Kavousi in May, June, July, August, and October. I've seen the Kastro dry and dusty, covered with wildflowers, and just starting to brown up for winter. I've seen it crawling with humans and utterly deserted. I'm delighted that Chris wanted to return after his first visit. 

And though neither Chris or I can claim to be an archaeologist of any description, our return to Kavousi was the ideal finish for a sabbatical project intended to feel the texture of the landscape in real time. Though much changes, much abides. Crete remains sunbaked, rocky, and steep. We can still walk to the Kastro on a trail made by Turks to improve a footpath walked by Minoans, enhanced with dirt roads made by 20th-century Cretans. To get a sense of what it means to be a human in the physical world, we could do a lot worse than that.
