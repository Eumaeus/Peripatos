# Olive Tree

If you visit the little village of [Kavousi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kavousi) in eastern Crete, after you have explored the [20 churches within a 1-mile radius of the town center](https://eumaeus.substack.com/p/the-churches-of-kavousi-crete), there are other things you can do.

You can seek refreshment at [Café Chez George](https://maps.app.goo.gl/qoYiePT9DwJ5Fgvg7) or a lovely and substantial dinner at [Ntakos](https://maps.app.goo.gl/AYUdngVJhSqVFU3z6). Or you can buy [rusks, or *paximadia*](https://greekreporter.com/2022/05/14/paximadia-the-cretan-greek-superfood/) in bags from [Café Chez George](https://maps.app.goo.gl/qoYiePT9DwJ5Fgvg7) and make your own [Ndakos, or Ntakos, or Dakos, salad](https://www.simplyrecipes.com/dakos-salad-recipe-5193718)!

The [Tholos Beach](https://www.crete-today.com/tholos-beach/) is a 30-minute walk downhill from Kavousi, through olive groves. There is a little cantina there, a pebbly beach, and the easiest hike in the world to an ancient Roman tholos-shaped granery.

But the real attraction of Kavousi, the one that causes Deluxe Motor Coaches to stop on the side of the main road, is the [Sacred Olive Tree](https://www.argophilia.com/news/sacred-olive-tree-of-kavousi/236220/). This living relic of pre-Christian times continues to attract pilgrims to Kavousi.

There are [many](https://www.rental-center-crete.com/blog/the-oldest-and-sacred-olive-trees-of-crete/), [many](https://www.argophilia.com/news/sacred-olive-tree-of-kavousi/236220/), [many](https://www.cretetravel.com/en/activity/91/Walking_Tour_&_Visiting_The_Ancient_Olive_Tree_In_Kavousi), [many](https://www.eastcretemarketers.com/post/monumental-and-ancient-olive-tree-of-kavousi) websites that will tell you all about this olive tree. Briefly, it is **huge**, with a maximum diameter of 4.9 meters (17 feet), and a  max circumference of 14.2 meters (46.5 feet). It has been dated to c. 1,350–1,100 BC, making it between 3,124 and 3,364 years old.

It is as old as the "lush olive tree" ([τανύφυλλος](http://folio2.furman.edu/lsj/?urn=urn:cite2:hmt:lsj.chicago_md:n102367) [ἐλαίη](http://folio2.furman.edu/lsj/?urn=urn:cite2:hmt:lsj.chicago_md:n33308)) under which Odysseus awoke when the Phaeacians first returned him home to Ithaca ([Homer, *Odyssey*, 13.93-13.125](https://scaife.perseus.org/reader/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002.perseus-grc2:13.93-13.125?right=perseus-eng3)). It is the result of a [*Mastoidis*](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Main-areas-of-cultivation-of-olive-cvs-Koroneiki-Mastoidis-and-Throubolia-in-the_fig1_319269040) olive shoot grafted centuries ago onto a wild olive stock. In his book [*The Other Greeks*](https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Other_Greeks/M7tFOBAz3LsC?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=victor+Davis+hanson&printsec=frontcover) Victor Davis Hansen writes about how the technology of grafting, applied to the olive, is an unsung heroic moment in the history of human culture.

What interests me is that this tree is a tourist attraction. Kavousi isn't exactly on the way anywhere, but people drive out and up into the hills to see this tree. I think I understand. Quite frankly, all Bronze Age archaeological sites look pretty much the same, unless they have been subject to controversial restoration.

The fact that this tree is still alive, has been living and growing through so many centuries, as human history went on and on, speaks to some people, perhaps more so than do dusty excavated foundation-walls and cisterns.

If you are waiting at the Department of Motor Vehicles or on hold with the cable company, you can have fun going to [TripAdvisor and reading the reviews of the Olive Tree of Kavousi](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g2277889-d11815873-Reviews-Azorias_Ancient_Olive_Tree-Kavousi_Lasithi_Prefecture_Crete.html).
