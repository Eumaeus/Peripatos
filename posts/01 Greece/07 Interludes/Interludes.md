# Interludes

## Interlude 1. Thessaloniki: September 4–6

Our trip started in North Carolina. Our wonderful friend Pat Kennedy generously agreed to drive us all the way to the Charlotte airport, which was immensely kind of him. 

![And we're off!](images/CLT_IMG_2183.jpg)

We have long favored flying direct from Charlotte to Munich to avoid domestic connections and be best positioned for transfers within Europe. So we took Lufthansa from Charlotte to Munich and then Aegean Air from Munich to Thessaloniki with a very short connection between flights.

Our Lufthansa flight to Munich was slightly delayed. We landed at the very minute our connecting flight to Thessaloniki began boarding.

In most airports, that would be a hopeless lost cause. Not so in [Munich Flughafen](https://www.munich-airport.com)! By refusing to despair and sprinting as much we could, we made it from our plane up two flights of stairs, through passport control, onto the little train between terminals, and onto our next plane while the door was still open. This was a good thing, because the next flight was 12 hours later; Munich is a nice airport, but 12 hours is a long time to sit around.

Alas, and not unexpectedly, our checked bags did not make that transition and failed to meet us in Thessaloniki. Ah well. We reported the lost bags and then caught a cab to our [apartment](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/622265835737012896?source_impression_id=p3_1737042040_P3QN32q1Qtn9XF0Y).

We were staying in downtown Thessaloniki, near the waterfront and the commercial area. 

![Thessaloniki waterfront](images/Thessaloniki_waterfront_IMG_1488.jpg)

The temperature was in the high 90s, but our place had efficient modern mini-air conditioners in every room and thick windows to keep out traffic noise. (We once spent a July week in an un-air-conditioned apartment in Paris; you can choose between suffocating from heat but having a relatively quiet room or opening the windows for some circulation, still sweating, but also hearing traffic all night long. Air conditioning is a great improvement to urban living!)

We really didn't do much in Thessaloniki aside from recover from travel fatigue. We walked around the harbor when things cooled off in the evening. 

![Thessaloniki still has triremes!](images/Thessaloniki_ships_IMG_1487.jpg)

We visited the statues of Alexander the Great and his dad. 

![Alexander the Great is from this neck of the woods.](images/Thessaloniki_Alexander_IMG_1002.jpg)

![Philip of Macedon, Alexander's father.](images/Thessaloniki_Philip_IMG_0999.jpg)

We ate [seafood](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189473-d27505959-Reviews-Psarista-Thessaloniki_Thessaloniki_Region_Central_Macedonia.html). The first night, Chris was tired so I dined alone. The next night, the proprietor saved a special fish just for me!

![Carving the 2 kilogram fish.](images/Thessaloniki_fish_Psarista_IMG_1490.MOV)

We had only the clothes we'd travelled in, which grew annoying when our bags repeatedly failed to rejoin us. I grabbed a few new things for us at [H&M](https://www.hm.com/om/store-locator/greece/thessaloniki/40-tsimiski-street/), but that was no real solution. Finally, at the end of our second day in Thessaloniki, the baggage company informed us that the bags were definitely loaded on the evening flight. They would surely be delivered to our apartment sometime the next afternoon! 

Ah, but our apartment would no longer be our apartment. By the next afternoon, we were expected to be in Gavalou, four hours away. That wouldn't do at all.

Chris saved the day through heroic action. After dinner, he took a city bus back to the airport to meet the  flight arriving from Munich around 11 pm. 

Now, in European airports, the baggage claim is within the secured area. You can't just stroll in there from the street like we do in the U.S. But Chris showed the officials our claim tickets and talked his way into the baggage claim, where collected the bags and returned with them after midnight. Clean clothes!!!!

We were ready to drive to Gavalou!


## Interlude 2. Gavalou: September 6–9

> We planned our 2024 trip through Greece with breaks throughout, during which we could stay in apartments and live semi-normal lives for a few days between multi-day hikes. [Trekking Hellas](https://trekking.gr) hikes are extremely well-organized and the hotels are always comfortable and hospitable, but it is tiring to move from place to place every night, and keeping up with laundry can be a challenge.

> So every week or two, we'd stop someplace, live in a house, and catch our breaths. We picked our break locations for geographic convenience, historical interest, and nostalgia. These interludes were just as much a part of the trip as the hikes. 

This morning I was awakened from my jet-lagged sleep by a phone call from my friend Georgia, calling from [Gavalou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavalou). I could hear a rooster in the background. Georgia and her husband George Coundoussias live in Greenville near us, but George still owns a house in his native Gavalou. We were planning to spend the weekend with them in the village. I assured her that we'd be along that afternoon.

We first had to collect our rental car. Thessaloniki's airport is on the east side of the city, so it's not a great place to collect a car if you want to drive west. Chris had reserved a mid-sized SUV (read: station wagon) at the [Sixt car rental agency](https://www.sixt.com/?sxamc=Google%7CSearch&fir=1&gad_source=1&gbraid=0AAAAAD98fIVavYdpqm6u-AGR7ttqsHQVg&gclid=CjwKCAiAm-67BhBlEiwAEVftNnOoKQlEv_hvA5NeutuuBqhvWqBx3TPs59lQWY7CB82fyIJefN-BdRoC_OkQAvD_BwE) by the port, which would put us on the road out of town; 

![This was our first car, a Skoda. Highly recommended!](images/Thessaloniki_Skoda_IMG_1492.jpg)

We were on the road by 10:30, with only minimal difficulty getting out of town and onto the highway. We started out on the A2 highway, which crosses northern Greece from northeast to southwest. This gave us a great overview of the Macedonian terrain--it's mountainous! In Ioannina, we switched to the A5 to head south along the west coast.

![About 4.5 hours. An easy and fun drive!](images/thes_gavalou.jpg)

[Gavalou](https://www.greece.com/destinations/Central_Greece/Etoloakarnania/Town/Gavalou.html#google_vignette) is a small village (population around 1300) in central Greece, about half an hour north of the Gulf of Corinth.

![George's house](images/Gavalou_George_house_IMG_1555.jpg)

Friday night, the town held a folk dancing festival at the high school. The festivities went well into the not-so-wee hours; I highly recommend earplugs!

![Our friends Ioannis and Ionannina watch the folk dancing at Gavalou High School (Γυμνάσιο Γαβαλούς)](images/Gavalou_festival_high_school_IMG_1497.jpg)

On Saturday, we had an outing to Nafpaktos, the site of a famous naval battle between Athens and Sparta in the Peloponnesian War. It is also where the "Children of Heracles" were supposed to have crossed over to invade the Peloponnese and found the Dorian race.

![Chris and I climbed up to see the Venetian fortress](images/Nafpaktos_view_IMG_1500.jpg)

![It had a great view of the Gulf of Corinth to the bridge at Patras.](images/Nafpaktos_view_IMG_1500.jpg)

![We went swimming at a local beach.](images/Nafpaktos_beach_IMG_1514.jpg)

![Then we had a lovely seafood lunch.](images/Nafpaktos_lunch_IMG_1516.jpg)

![These cats were interested in our fish.](images/Nafpaktos_lunch_cats_IMG_1519.jpg)

That evening, Gavalou held another festival, this one for folk singing.

![The folk singing started around 9:00 p.m.](images/Gavalou_folksongs_IMG_1524.jpg)

![Everyone in town came to watch and enjoy the evening.](images/Gavalou_folk_singing_crowd_plateia_IMG_1527.jpg)

We'd planned to get up early to go to the monastery on Sunday morning, but that didn't happen. Instead, we drove up to Thermos, where Chris and I visited the archaeological site and museum while our hosts sat at a taverna and drank coffee.

![The site at Thermos](images/Thermos_site_IMG_1531.jpg)

![I took this picture in the museum when no one was looking.](images/Thermos_vase_IMG_1528.jpg)

![The figs were all ripening this week.](images/Thermos_ripe_fig_IMG_1540.jpg)

![A succulent moussaka.](images/Thermos_lunch_IMG_1554.jpg)

This was George's last night in Gavalou, so he hosted a big dinner for all his friends and family. 

![We began the evening sitting in the town square, where I enjoyed my new favorite drink: Tuborg Lemoni.](images/Gavalou_Tuborg_Lemoni_IMG_1558.jpg)

We ate *a lot* of french fries. Each platter of roast meat came on a bed of fries, and our friends orders many "side orders" (read, huge platters) of fries. They were excellent fries!

![Dinner started outside, but an unexpected rainstorm sent us indoors.](images/Gavalou_last_dinner_IMG_1560.jpg)

On Monday morning, George and Georgia headed to Athens for their flight home the next day. Chris and I bade them a fond farewell and headed back north to [Meteora](https://meteora.com/meteora-monasteries/).

## Interlude 3. Meteora: September 9–10

> We planned our 2024 trip through Greece with breaks throughout, during which we could stay in apartments and live semi-normal lives for a few days between multi-day hikes. [Trekking Hellas](https://trekking.gr) hikes are extremely well-organized and the hotels are always comfortable and hospitable, but it is tiring to move from place to place every night, and keeping up with laundry can be a challenge.

> So every week or two, we'd stop someplace, live in a house, and catch our breaths. We picked our break locations for geographic convenience, historical interest, and nostalgia. These interludes were just as much a part of the trip as the hikes. 


![Meteora, land of monasteries](images/Meteora_monastery_fog_IMG_1617.jpg)

We started our day reversing our drive to Gavalou, driving north up the A5 to Ioannina and then heading back east on the A2. This time, we got off at the exit for Meteora and headed west-south-west.

![Gavalou to Meteora. Crossing the mountains up north took up most of the time.](images/Gav-meteora.jpg)

This was our first foray into Greek mountain driving. We found ourselves on a narrow road that serpentined up and down the hillside for quite some time. Local etiquette dictates that slower drivers pull over to let faster ones pass; on roads like this, though, everyone can get stuck behind a truck or bus. And the local roads are the only roads; the buses and trucks have to use them.

We arrived in the Meteora area around 1:00. [Meteora](https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/455/) is a collection of sandstone peaks with several monasteries and convents situated on their tips. The otherworldly appearance of the area makes it a wildly popular tourist attraction.

![The sandstone pillars are immediately identifiable.](images/Meteora_approach_IMG_1563.jpg)

Our first task was to find our AirBnB. I didn't really know much about how Meteora works when I was booking our accommodations, and it's surprisingly hard to figure out what exactly people do there and where to stay. 

It turns out that Meteora's monasteries are situated near two towns: the small [Kastraki](https://visitmeteora.travel/kastraki-village-meteora/) and the larger [Kalabaka](https://visitmeteora.travel/kalabaka-town/). If you search for accommodation near Meteora, most of your results will be in those places. I chose a place in Kastraki based partly on the notion that we might be able to walk to the monasteries from there; while that was possible in principle, we ended up mostly driving.

Finding [Maria's place](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/759355180778081772?source_impression_id=p3_1736177835_P3Sjr_EccUodu0Tl) was a challenge. We drove back and forth through the center of Kastraki several times before we realized that what looked like a blind driveway was in fact the start of the road that led to the house. 

Maria spoke only Greek. Her 20-something son spoke good English, though. We had a one-bedroom apartment on the ground floor, right next to a garden full of grapes and pomegranates and with an extraordinary view of the site. They'd set up the apartment with full hotel amenities, including supplies for breakfast. Maria's dad was working in his garden. He cut clusters of grapes for both of us; Chris still talks about how those were the most delicious grapes he'd ever eaten!

![Maria and her family live in part of the house. They rent out the rest of it.](images/Meteora_house_Kastraki_IMG_1602.jpg)

We only had one night in Meteora, so we set off right away to see if we could see the monasteries. From Kastraki, you reach them by driving up a winding mountain road (this is a theme in Greece). Most people go visit the monasteries themselves; each one is known for paintings or libraries or some other feature. Each one has its own opening hours, so you have to check beforehand to see if it'll be open when you arrive. Some of them serve lunch. The Internet is full of blogs describing visits to the monasteries and individual tourists' favorites.

And that's about all I can tell you about the site. The fact is, Chris and I didn't actually want to visit the monasteries. We were much more interested in the exterior experience, the terrain and the vistas. As on the [Menalon Trail](https://trekking.gr/en/excursions/menalon-trail-hiking-tour-self-guided), we felt uncomfortable visiting hermitages just to fill in tourism time, and we try very hard to avoid crowds. 

But Meteora gets some 200,000 visitors a year, so crowds we found. At the top of the road leading to the monasteries, parked cars covered every inch of the sides, reducing the traversable portion to a single lane. Buses and cars heading downhill made it impossible to proceed up. We couldn't see how this could end in a pleasant experience, and we didn't know where we were going anyway. Chris seized the first opportunity to turn around and drive back downhill, stopping at the first taverna we saw. Sometimes lunch is the only answer!

Fortified by food, we investigated the possibility of hiking around the area. There are trails, to be sure, but we struggled to figure out where they started and what they were like. Finally, we found one that looked like it would take maybe half an hour and reward us with a good view. 

After a struggle to drive to the trailhead and then to figure out where to park on the very narrow town roads, we set off into the rock formations. The walk started among some houses on a very narrow "paved" road, then through some forest and up a short, steep hill. We eschewed a leftward path along a cliff-face toward a boulder famous among climbers, and came to a ridge with a great view over the next valley, including the inevitable monasteries.

![Our short first walk of the trip. Meteora is a mecca for climbers, hence the cute names of boulders, cliffs, &c.](images/meteora_hike.jpg)

![Short, but climby!](images/meteora_elevation.jpg)

![Sandstone pillars up close.](images/Meteora_hike_IMG_1569.jpg)

![Hermits lived in the caves up here.](images/Meteora_hike_scary_trail_IMG_1570.jpg)

After narrowly avoiding taking the (scarily exposed) trail up to the hermit caves, we scrambled up onto a boulder and were rewarded with this view:

![How did they get those monasteries up there?](images/IMG_1098.jpg)

Meteora really is extraordinary; the monasteries seem physically impossible, perched on top of the sandstone fingers seemingly with no way up or down. Hundreds of years ago, people were hauled up by ropes that were replaced "only when God willed it"; presumably God showed His Will by breaking the ropes under the weight of some hapless soul who fell to a terrifying death.

After our hike, we headed into the town of Kalambaka to get some groceries at the [Lidl](https://www.lidl-hellas.gr/s/el-GR/Αναζήτηση-καταστήματος/kalamata/lakonikis/lakonikis/). 

![Even the grocery store parking lot has an amazing view!](images/Meteora_Lidle_view_IMG_1585.jpg)

![Chris couldn't find any adult-sized grocery carts.](images/Meteora_Lidl_IMG_1583.jpg)

Though many tourists try to visit the [sunset rock](https://peterorsel.com/meteora-guide/) to watch the sun go down, we spent the evening enjoying the view from our garden. Chris flew one of his two drones (Droney McDroneface II). We planned to get an early start the next day so that we could get up onto the monastery road before the tour buses arrived.

![Why drive when you've got a view at home?](images/Meteora_sunset_IMG_1586.jpg)

![This little girl is named Natalia. She speaks good English and likes kitties.](images/Meteora_Natalia_cat_IMG_1591.jpg)

![There are worse offices.](images/Meteora_house_Chris_working_IMG_1604.jpg)

The next morning dawned foggy and misty. 

![Good morning, Meteora!](images/Meteora_foggy_dawn_IMG_1605.jpg)

Chris jumped out of bed and dashed out to fire up his drone; videos of the sandstone pillars in the fog would be amazing!

Alas, drones don't do well in moisture. The drone sent an error message and then... nothing. It never returned. Alas!

Fortunately, we had a spare drone. Unfortunately, Chris hadn't downloaded the videos he'd shot the previous day before sending this first drone to its death, so we have no drone videos at all from Meteora. Lesson learned!

But the monasteries were still there, and the fog would surely add to the ambiance. It was early yet, so we got into the Skoda and drove back up the mountain. This time, the road was empty and we could park where we liked.

![This is the rock from which people like to watch the sunset.](images/Meteora_Chris_fog_IMG_1632.jpg)

![And this view is why they like to watch from there.](images/Meteora_fog_view_IMG_1638.jpg)

![Foggy ambiance.](images/Meteora_DJI_20240910004314_0161_D.MP4)

We left Meteora around noon and drove off through the plain of Thessaly toward Volos and the Pelion peninsula. It was time to start our tour of [Mount Pelion](https://trekking.gr/en/excursions/hike-mt-pelion-self-guided)!

**And then we hiked around Pelion for a week, September 11–16. We'll link to the full write-up here once we get it done!.**

## Interlude 4. Kamena Vourla—and Thermopylae!: September 17–20

> We planned our 2024 trip through Greece with breaks throughout, during which we could stay in apartments and live semi-normal lives for a few days between multi-day hikes. [Trekking Hellas](https://trekking.gr) hikes are extremely well-organized and the hotels are always comfortable and hospitable, but it is tiring to move from place to place every night, and keeping up with laundry can be a challenge.

> So every week or two, we'd stop someplace, live in a house, and catch our breaths. We picked our break locations for geographic convenience, historical interest, and nostalgia. These interludes were just as much a part of the trip as the hikes. 

The morning after finished our tour of Mount Pelion, we awoke in the charming hill town of Portaria. An hour-long taxi ride returned us to Milies and our Skoda, which was safe in the parking lot where we'd left it looking out over the Pagasitic Gulf.

![The Skoda had a nice view while we were hiking.](images/Milies_Skoda_IMG_1989.jpg)

After a quick drink at our favorite café in Milies and a quick conversation leading to a plant identification, we drove back down the mountain to the coast, north to Volos, and then headed south on the A1/E75. This took us down to the Malian Gulf. We turned west to reach the town of Lamia, rounded the gulf, and then returned east through Thermopylae on our way to [Kamena Vourla](https://www.greecetravel.com/kamena-vourla/index.htm), where we would spend the next three nights.

![An easy drive to Kamena-Vourla.](images/millies_kv.jpg)

[Kamena Vourla](https://www.mitsis.com/en/destination/kamena-vourla), for those unfamiliar, is a beach town on the south side of the Malian Gulf. It's not the best beach; the water is kind of dank and the shore is all pebbles, but it's a short drive from Athens. I didn't actually choose Kamena Vourla as our location; I just searched for accommodation near Thermopylae and Lamia. Our house wasn't even in town; it was a good two miles away. But the house looked nice, and with a car, we didn't need to stay close to shops or transportation. The thought of a "villa" was most appealing.

![Our house](images/KamenaVourla_house_IMG_1991.jpg)

![Our "beach"](images/KamenaVourla_beach_IMG_1994.jpg)

The whole point of staying here was to put us near Thermopylae. As everyone no doubt knows, Thermopylae was the site of a battle fought in 480 BCE between the Persians under emperor Xerxes (the invading force) and the Greek city-states (defending their homeland). Spartan king Leonidas and his force of 300 Spartan warriors famously held them off at the "Hot Gates," a narrow pass on the coastline. We were keen to see this landscape!

To refresh our memories of the details, we watched the movie *300* as historical prep. It really isn't bad for a quick and engaging refresher of the key characters and events. To sum up: Persia is invading Greece. King Leonidas of Sparta leads an army, including 300 special forces dudes, all the way to the "Hot Gates," a narrow pass where they set up shop and manage to keep the Persians at bay until they're betrayed by one Ephialtes, who leads the Persians up and around a "goat path" to get behind the Spartan forces and kill them to a man. 

![The great Leonidas in Sparta](images/Sparta_Leonidas_IMG_2401.jpg)

This story is a great favorite of burly American guys. It give us the phrase "Mōlon Labe"—Μόλων Λάβε, which modern Greek often transliterates to "Molon Lave"—"Come and take them!", or more literally, "Having come, take!", uttered by the Spartans in response to the Persians' demand for their weapons. It's the origin of the line "Go tell the Spartans", which itself is the title of a 1978 movie about Vietnam starring Burt Lancaster; my uncle Frank had this film on videotape, and my military-minded cousin Mark adored that movie.

![Molon Lave is now the name of a brand of olive oil sold in Sparta.](images/Sparta_Molon_Lave_IMG_2425.jpg)

We wanted to see the terrain. "Thermopylae" does mean "Hot gates," but what are the gates? The movie portrays the gates as a narrow pass between two high cliffs, but that's not what you see on the ground. There are fairly steep mountains to the south of the beach, but then there's a coastal plain at least half a mile wide. 

The answer to this question lies in the gradual silting up of the Malian Gulf. Over the centuries, the beach on the south coast has become wider and wider. 2500 years ago, though, the beach might have been only a few feet wide in places. This would create a narrow corridor of flat land between the mountains and the water, which would indeed function as a sort of gate.

![Thermopylae may have sort of looked like this in 480 BC (part of our walk on the coast of Crete)](images/Themopylae_coast.mp4)

The "hot" part of the hot gates refers to the hot sulfur springs in the area.

How did Leonidas and his gang, from distant Sparta, formulate this plan? Everyone knew where the Thermopylae were, since the "Gates" were on the main route from the north to the south, dodging the high mountains around Parnassus. Any army aiming at Euboea, Attica, and the Peloponnese would have to walk through the "Hot Gates". Some places tend to be places where battles happen, based on their geography; the fight between Greeks and Persians was not the last battle to be fought at Thermopylae over the centuries.

The "goat path" is plausible enough. Those mountains are still riddled with high paths, many of which are hard to find and would likely require a local guide. Certainly some of the trails marked on maps looked daunting! Thermopylae may have a little unusual in that it had only one path up and around. The path seems to have been at the same time well-known enough to have a name—the Anopaea—but obscure enough that a guy from Trachis, Ephialtes, had to show the Persians. (The whole "Ephialtes was a deformed failed Spartan" thing was made up for the movie.)

![The Anopaea goat-path was up there.](images/Thermopylae_IMG_2014.jpg)

![When you picture "goat path", this bit of trail from Crete might be somewhat realistic. Maybe add some trees to your mental image.](images/Goad_path_clipped.mp4)

The site at Thermopylae isn't terribly illuminating; this is the kind of place that might benefit from an enthusiastic guide to make it come to life. The [famous monument with the poetic epigraph by Simonides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Thermopylae#Epitaph_of_Simonides) was under repair and blocked off. The museum isn't bad, though. The staff were really nice, and the CGI film you can watch is cool.

![Triremes were part of the Battle of Artemisium, but they didn't have much to do with the last stand of the 300 Spartans.](images/Thermopylae_trireme_IMG_1355.jpg)

Our location on the south short of the Malian Gulf gave us a good perspective on the geography of the whole area. The shore of Euboeia was clearly visible across the water, as was the strait of Artemisium between Euboeia and the mainland leading toward the Pelion Peninsula. 

![Looking straight toward Euboeia](images/KamenaVourla_Euboiea_IMG_2024.jpg)

![Ominous weather](images/KamenaVourla_storm_IMG_1368.jpg)

Other than pondering the battle of Thermopylae, our main objective for these three days in Kamena Vourla were to get our laundry done, catch up on work, and eat at home for once. 

![A nice place to work!](images/KamenaVourla_porch_IMG_1996.jpg)

![The view is distracting, though.](images/KamenaVourla_patio_IMG_1995.jpg)

We walked around the neighborhood, which was mostly olive groves.

![Very lazy dogs](images/KamenaVourla_dogs_olives_IMG_2001.jpg)

We made trips into town to shop at the [Galaxias](https://5ae.gr) grocery stores (two within half a kilometer of each other!) and to stroll the waterfront. I suppose it wouldn't be a bad place to spend a few days in the summer, especially if you like ride in boats. The waterfront strip has all the expected touristic tavernas.

![Galaxias house-brand Choco Pops](images/Galaxias_Choco_Pops_IMG_2431.jpg)

![Kamena Vourla has lots of little boats.](images/KamenaVourla_boats_IMG_2004.jpg)

In addition to *300*, we watched *Life of Brian* (perhaps the funniest movie ever) and part of *300*'s sequel about the Battle of Salamis (unwatchable, stupid, and a complete waste of money).

It was nice to have our own house for a few days. And then it was time to head south to the Pelopponesus and the Menalon Trail!

## Interlude 5. Mystra and Sparti: September 26-27

> We planned our 2024 trip through Greece with breaks throughout, during which we could stay in apartments and live semi-normal lives for a few days between multi-day hikes. [Trekking Hellas](https://trekking.gr) hikes are extremely well-organized and the hotels are always comfortable and hospitable, but it is tiring to move from place to place every night, and keeping up with laundry can be a challenge.

> So every week or two, we'd stop someplace, live in a house, and catch our breaths. We picked our break locations for geographic convenience, historical interest, and nostalgia. These interludes were just as much a part of the trip as the hikes. 

When we finished the [Menalon Trail](https://trekking.gr/en/excursions/menalon-trail-hiking-tour-self-guided), we drove to Sparta. Well, Sparti, as it's called today.

Driving out of Arkadia into the plain where Sparta lies was like driving from autumn back into summer. The leaves turned from red to green. The shade turned into sunshine. And it got HOT!

![Driving through Sparti](images/Sparta_city_IMG_2356.MOV)

To conclude our Pelopponesian hiking sojourn, I'd asked [Trekking Hellas](https://trekking.gr/en) to book us into the first night's accommodation for its [E4 Trail Mt. Taygetus](https://trekking.gr/en/excursions/e4-trail-mttaygetus). This trip begins in Mystras, which is right down the street from Sparti. The rest of the trek concentrates on summiting the mountain, so it's much more wilderness-oriented than cultural. We didn't really need another multi-day climb on top of the Menalon Trail, but we did need to see Sparta.

The key attraction in Mystras is the [archaeological site](https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/511/) set on a hill above town. 

![It's way up that hill. Be prepared to climb even if you drive there!](images/Mystras_site_on_hill_IMG_2381.jpg)

Unlike many of the sites we've visited in Greece, this site is Byzantine. It has a Frankish castle dating from the 13th century, a bunch of Byzantine church buildings, and lots of houses. 

![Marble plaque of the Ascension of Alexander the Great, late 14th century. I grabbed this photo when the docent wasn't looking!](images/Mystras_plaque_Alexander_IMG_2366.jpg)

![Seems like AI might be ideal for figuring out what these frescoes must have originally looked like.](images/Mystras_fresco_IMG_2370.jpg)

![Charms to bring health to specific body parts.](images/Mystras_charms_IMG_2371.jpg)

Mystras looks like it would be a pretty interesting site to wander around. Alas, Chris' old stress-fracture was hurting, so we gave the main site short shrift and then drove uphill to fly the drone.

![The Spartans, fearing nothing, lived down on the plain; the Franks thought it prudent to perch their city up on this cliff.](images/mistras_orbit_drone.mp4)

The next morning, we headed to ancient Sparta. And… we couldn't figure out how to get in. For the longest time! Apple Maps kept directing us to a locked back gate.

![These directions are not helpful.](images/map_sparta.jpg)

![The way into the site is blocked. Thou shall not pass!](images/Sparta_locked_gate_IMG_2390.jpg)

This was incredibly stupid. We could SEE people strolling around inside. Sparta isn't even a ticketed site; it's a public park, and people can just walk in and out.

But that gate kept us out of Sparta no better than the Gates of Thermopylae kepts the Persians out of Greece. After some arguing back and forth and revisiting the same back road, we finally arrived at a more likely location: the statue of Leonidas in the heart of Sparta. And sure enough, the wide-open entrance to the site is behind him to his right.

![A popular site for field trips. Greece is rightly proud of its martial heritage.](images/Sparta_statue_fieldtrip_trimmed.mov)

![The somewhat modest way into the site.](images/Sparta_entrance_IMG_2404.jpg)

In keeping with the Spartan tradition, the ancient site is now a popular location to go for a jog. Unusual for Greece, it's fairly flat; it's a nice site to visit if you want a break from climbing hills!

![See how flat!](images/Sparta_walkway_IMG_2407.jpg)

![A theatre.](images/Sparta_site_IMG_2412.jpg)

![Chris exploring ancient Sparta. Active excavation is going on.](images/Sparta_Chris_IMG_2410.MOV)

It didn't take too long to get through the site. But we got what we wanted out of this brief interlude, which was just to see where Sparta was located. The fact that it's in a relatively flat plain is huge; it makes life so much easier when you aren't constantly trudging up and down mountains! The fierce sunlight would've made it super easy to grow crops, and indeed even today the place is awash in a sea of olive trees. We imagined nations of Helots toiling in the olive groves while the Spartiates toiled at their Cross-Fit™ and MMA. Sparta looks like it would've been a nice place to live, except for the toiling.

But it was time to head north! We were on our way to Nafplio for a recovery weekend. We took the E961, which might lie on the same route that Leonidas and his 300 Spartans took when they started marching to Thermopylae. But we parted company with them in Tripoli and headed west toward the Argolic Gulf.

## Interlude 6. Nafplio: September 27–30

> We planned our 2024 trip through Greece with breaks throughout, during which we could stay in apartments and live semi-normal lives for a few days between multi-day hikes. [Trekking Hellas](https://trekking.gr) hikes are extremely well-organized and the hotels are always comfortable and hospitable, but it is tiring to move from place to place every night, and keeping up with laundry can be a challenge.

> So every week or two, we'd stop someplace, live in a house, and catch our breaths. We picked our break locations for geographic convenience, historical interest, and nostalgia. These interludes were just as much a part of the trip as the hikes. 


![Palamidi fortress](images/Nafplio_Palamidi_DSC_0081_2.jpg)

At the midpoint of our two-month trip, we spent a weekend relaxing in [Nafplio](https://www.discovernafplio.gr/en). 

We picked Nafplio for several reasons. It was conveniently located between Sparta and Athens, where we needed to return our car and catch our ferry. It's beautiful and well-served with amenities. It was familiar territory; we've spent time there on projects with the Center for Hellenic Studies, which has an office in the town. We could also knock off Mycenae and Epidaurus.

Also, I found the NICEST apartment!

![So spacious!](images/Nafplio_apartment_IMG_2450.jpg)

### Nafplio 2008-2009

In 2008, we went to Nafplio to set up the copystand that the CHS had commissioned for the [2007 Venetus A project](http://www.homermultitext.org). We returned the next year to pack the thing back up and transport it to Patras, where Chris and our sister-in-law Casey Dué Hackney presented a talk at the university there. Both times we found Nafplio to be charming.

![The Harvard Center for Hellenic Studies building in Nafplio.](images/Nafplio_2008_CHS_DSC_0083_2.jpg)

![Conservation copystand designed to hold old manuscripts for photography.](images/Nafplio_2008_copystand_DSCF2056.jpg)

![Casey working hard at her computer.](images/Nafplio_2009_Casey_DSC_0115.jpg)

Like most Greek towns, Nafplio has remnants of Venetian and Turkish dominance. The [Bourtzi Castle](https://www.discovernafplio.gr/en/articles/archaeological-sites/bourtzi) in the harbor is one of the eye-catching landmarks.

![Chris spent a night in this castle, on its roof, when he was 12.](images/Nafplio_2008_DSC_0076_3.jpg)

[Palamidi](https://www.visitnafplio.com/palamidi.html) is a Venetian fortress up above the city. Back in 2008, we made a rule that everyone who arrived that week had to climb to the top; it was a good ice breaker!

![Chris and Manfred are almost at the top of the climb.](images/Nafplio_2008_Palamidi_DSC_0054_3.jpg)

![Amy up above Nafplio, looking much younger!](images/Nafplio_2008-_Amy_Palamidi_DSC_0034_3.jpg)

Nafplio was and is a big beach resort, packed with tourists in the summer. 

![Prickly pears cover the hillsides.](images/Nafplio_2008_beach_view_DSC_0035_4.jpg)

![The water was cold and the beach was pebbly!](images/Nafplio_2008_swimming_DSCF2058.jpg)

My, but we looked younger then! Amazing what a difference 16 years can make. 

### Nafplio 2025

Though we are not now that strength which in old days moved earth and heaven, that which we are, we are. Also, this time we had our own car!

We arrived in Nafplio on Friday afternoon, found our [apartment](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/887012326973720258?source_impression_id=p3_1736868874_P38ItGPQ07w8VeQY), and met our host's dad. As per usual, Dad lived downstairs and handled all logistics. Anastasia handled all communications, but we never saw her.

Nafplio itself hadn't changed much, though it did seem to have a LOT more people in it. 

![Bourtzi Castle was still there.](images/Nafplio_Bourtzi_IMG_2442.jpg)

![One massive perk of our beautiful apartment was not one but TWO balconies! (We ended up using one of them as a clothes drier, but still.)](images/Nafplio_sunset_IMG_2455.jpg)

### Our fun weekend

Chris came down with a stomach bug the first night, which put a bit of a damper on our activities. I spent Saturday walking around town by myself. I bought a new case for my iphone (badly needed) and found the Lidl (useful).

![The beach hasn't changed.](images/Nafplio_beach_IMG_2463.jpg)

![Lord Byron died fighting for Greece during its war of independence.](images/Nafplio_street_IMG_2469.jpg)

![Pray for mercy from Puss in Boots!](images/Nafplio_puss_IMG_2470.jpg)

It's not a terrible thing to have some downtime. 

Sunday morning, we were awakened by bells ringing everywhere, but most especially at the church just above our apartment.

![Just try sleeping through that!](images/Nafplio_church_bells_IMG_2474.MOV)

Chris was feeling a bit better, so we drove off to visit Mycenae. Though I studied the Aegean Bronze Age in some depth back in college, I didn't remember a heck of a lot about the site. But it must have been an excellent site for a citadel--it's high with a great view of the gulf and the surrounding plain, so you could see attackers a long way off.

![The mighty citadel of Mycenae](images/Mycenae_IMG_2478.jpg)

![The lion gates](images/Mycenae_lion_gate_IMG_2484.jpg)

![Lots of tourists on a September Sunday morning, but I'm sure this can't compare to August.](images/Mycenae_tourists_IMG_2491.MOV)

![We drove past Argos on the way back but couldn't be bothered to stop.](images/Argos_IMG_2511.jpg)

After a rest at home, we walked down into town to get a little air and exercise. 

![We considered buying a megayacht.](images/Nafplio_megayacht_IMG_2519.jpg)

![It's lovely just to sit at a café on the waterfront.](images/Nafplio_cafe_IMG_2524.jpg)

Back at our apartment, we were treated to an astonishing sunset. Wildfires had broken out near Corinth, and they filled the sky with smoke.

![Smoke-enhanced sunset](images/Nafplio_wildfires_IMG_2531.jpg)

## Interlude 7. Epidavros–Isthmus–Athens–Piraeus–Rhodes: September 30–October 1

> We planned our 2024 trip through Greece with breaks throughout, during which we could stay in apartments and live semi-normal lives for a few days between multi-day hikes. [Trekking Hellas](https://trekking.gr) hikes are extremely well-organized and the hotels are always comfortable and hospitable, but it is tiring to move from place to place every night, and keeping up with laundry can be a challenge.

> So every week or two, we'd stop someplace, live in a house, and catch our breaths. We picked our break locations for geographic convenience, historical interest, and nostalgia. These interludes were just as much a part of the trip as the hikes. 

September 30 was our last day on mainland Greece. We had to return our beloved Skoda and take ship for the far reaches of the Aegean.

We cleared out of our swanky apartment in Nafplio and headed across the peninsula to Epidauros. 

![The theatre at Epidavros. Climbing the steps is a workout!](images/Epidauros_IMG_2536.jpg)

Driving north from Epidavros, we hugged the coastline of the Saronic Gulf. This basically retraced the journey Theseus took to Athens, crossing the Isthmus of Corinth (with fire damage in evidence) and passing Eleusis and Megara (and also Salamis).

![Not a bad drive. The last time we were really in traffic on this trip.](images/nafplio-athens.jpg)

We crossed over the canal that cuts through the Isthmus. This canal was an ancient dream, the ancient equivalent to the Panama Canal, providing much easier access on the east-west sailing rough across the northern Aegean. Various Romans tried to dig a canal, and failed. It was finally completed in the 19th Century, and promptly became obsolete as ships got too big to use it. So it is a picturesque curiosity now, of no economic significance except to tavernas like the one we stopped at.

![We took a break at a café overlooking the Corinth Canal. Does this canal make the Peleponnesus an actual island in its own right?](images/Corinth_canal_west_IMG_2555.jpg)

![The little drawbridge over the canal](images/Corinth_canal_bridge_IMG_2548.jpg)

We're not the first people to think of Theseus on this route. Several of the A1 exits are named after characters in the Theseus story, including Sinis the pine-bender.

There's not much to say about the afternoon. We returned the rental car to the Athens airport, which involved all the stress and confusion you can imagine. We took a taxi to Piraeus, which was expensive and trafficky, but the driver was a nice guy. He told us about the island of Symi, right next to Rhodes, and his family's pilgrimage weekend there. He highly recommended the tiny Symi shrimp, which we were to discover the next week in Rhodos.

![Tiny shrimp are a must-eat on Rhodes!](images/Lindos_tiny_shrimp_IMG_2959.jpg)

The beauty of overnight ferries is that you can board them three hours before departure. (Well, you can if they originate where you are; obviously that's not the case if the ferry is just stopping in, as happened on our return from Rhodes to Piraeus.) Being able to stash bags or lie down in the middle of the afternoon makes life so much better. The Blue Star ferry customer service is exemplary, especially for passengers staying in cabins. Check-in is as nice as in any fine hotel, with uniformed porters escorting us to the cabin door. Wifi on these ships is marginal; the cabins are steel Farraday cages, so signal can't get through. But the cabins are comfortable and the ships have plenty of amenities, including a (small) white-tablecloth restaurant.

![By ship across the Aegean to Rhodes!](images/piraeus-rhodes.jpg)

![Seafood stew, a la Blue Star Lines](images/Blue_Star_seafood_stew_IMG_2610.jpg)

The ferry from Piraeus to Rhodes travels through the Dodecanese, stopping multiple times throughout the night. Our ferry stopped in Lipsi, Kalymnos, Kos, Nisyros, and Tilos while we slept. We mostly didn't notice the nocturnal halts. When we woke up, we were right next to Turkey!

![We watched the coast of Turkey go by until we reached Rhodes mid-morning.](images/Turkey_coast_trimmed.mov)

We were a good hour behind schedule, but we still had to stop in Symi. [Symi](https://visitsymi.gr/en/activities/religious-tourism/) is quite popular with tourists; the candy-colored main town is a draw, as is the famous [monastery of Archangel Michael Panormitis](https://greekcitytimes.com/2018/11/08/monastery-of-archangel-michael-in-panormitis/). [Day trips](https://wareontheglobe.com/2022/11/02/a-day-trip-to-symi-greece-from-rhodes/) to Symi are a mainstay of the Rhodian tourist industry.

![Coming into Symi harbor](images/Symi_harbor_trimmed.mov)

An hour later, we disembarked in Rhodes!

## Interlude 8. Rhodes–Piraeus–Santorini–Chania: October 9–12

> We planned our 2024 trip through Greece with breaks throughout, during which we could stay in apartments and live semi-normal lives for a few days between multi-day hikes. [Trekking Hellas](https://trekking.gr) hikes are extremely well-organized and the hotels are always comfortable and hospitable, but it is tiring to move from place to place every night, and keeping up with laundry can be a challenge.

> So every week or two, we'd stop someplace, live in a house, and catch our breaths. We picked our break locations for geographic convenience, historical interest, and nostalgia. These interludes were just as much a part of the trip as the hikes. 

We left our house in Kritika at 11:00. Our ferry to Piraeus departed at 18:15. That was a lot of time to kill.

We ended up sitting for several hours at a restaurant across from the ferry port. Fortunately, our computers were functioning well and we had plenty of work to do, so it wasn't a wasted day, but I do find these genuine interludes tedious.

We'd assumed we'd be able to board the ferry three hours ahead of departure, as we've done in Piraeus. Alas, this ferry didn't originate in Rhodes. I don't know where it started--maybe Sitia, Crete?--but it came to Rhodes from Karpathos. 

Apparently Rhodes, large though it is, isn't a major ferry route terminus. Some Blue Star ferries continue east from Rhodes all the way to the island of [Kastellorizo](https://www.visitgreece.gr/islands/dodecanese/kastellorizo/), or Megisti, a tiny place just off the Turkish coast that nevertheless still belongs to Greece. It's now famous as a ["secret" tiny island paradise](https://www.cntraveler.com/story/kastellorizo-greece). 

Anyway! Around 3:00, we headed over to the ferry port, only to discover no ferry. We would have to wait some more. 

![Waiting for the ferry.](images/waiting_for_ferry.jpg)

The ferry finally arrived and we boarded. Our cabin was at the bow of the ship this time, which would've been fun except that the window was completely salted over and most of the voyage was in the dark. But the ferry was comfortable as always, and we had a pleasant dinner in the fine-dining restaurant.

And something interesting did happen!

Around 10 pm, we stopped at the island of Kos. I went out on deck to at least lay eyes on Kos--former banking haven of the ancient world.

![After passengers disembark, they let the new ones on.](images/Kos_loading_ferry_short.mov)

There I witnessed a crowd of people being walked off the ferry and lined up by police. I couldn't see them well, but they looked like mostly young men in track suits. A bus parked next to them.

The police first loaded the women (in head scarves) and small children onto the bus. The men stood in line in pairs, their backpacks dropped on the pavement behind them. As we sailed away from Kos, the police were loading them onto the bus two by two. 

![An unpleasant way to spend 10:00 pm.](images/Kos_bus_guys_IMG_3142.jpg)

Were these migrants picked up somewhere in the Mediterranean and dropped off at Kos for detention? Kos is right next to Turkey; perhaps there were plans to take them there.

![Bye, Kos!](images/kos_departure.MOV)

The next morning, we awoke to find ourselves sailing past the Attic peninsula. We'd made good time, and were coming into port a good hour ahead of schedule. Ordinarily that would've been great, but in our case it just meant an additional hour to kill with all our luggage. Oh well!

![Coming into Pireaus](images/Piraeus_approach_IMG_3147.MOV)

A thing to note about Piraeus: the port is absolutely huge. It has to be, because lots of the ferries and cruise ships are huge. Our Blue Star ferry docked on one end of the port. Our Seajets ferry to Santorini would dock on the far end. So we started walking.

![We dragged our suitcases a long way!](images/Piraeus_IMG_3148.jpg)

![A 40-minute walk across a vast parking lot.](images/Piraeus_walk.jpg)

We found our next dock before 11:00 a.m. Our Seajets fast ferry wouldn't leave until 5:00. That means another day of killing time.

We dragged our suitcases out of the port and into Piraeus itself, which proved surprisingly hilly for a "flat" part of Athens. The sidewalks are also narrow and lumpy, with trees in the middle of them and lots of cars to dodge. It's really not a great place for whiling away time with suitcases. But we found a nice café, where I played solitaire. 

We had lunch at a German pretzel/American western establishment. 

![My ribs were surprisingly succulent, though they could've used more sauce.](images/Piraeus_ribs_IMG_3152.jpg)

We got ice cream at [Il Pinguino](https://restaurantguru.com/Il-pinguino-gelato-Pireas#google_vignette).

Piraeus is the main commercial port of Athens. It is separated by a little penninsula from a smaller harbor called (now) Passalimani, but in antiquity Zea. Zea was the harbor for triremes, the warships of the ancient Athenian navy, while food, merchandise, and passengers came and went from Piraeus.

![The two harbors of Athens, in antiquity.](images/ancient_zea.jpg)

A big innovation of historical significance was the building of the so-called Long Walls, in the 5th Century BC, after the Persian Wars. These connected the harbors—Piraeus, Zea, and Phalerum—with the walled city of Athens. This made Athens somewhat immune to siege, since its fortification had a "gate" straight into the sea, and thus access to the rest of the world. These walls had a lot to do with Athens surviving 27 years of the Peloponnesian War, the war with Sparta. It was only when the Spartans blocked the harbors in 404 BC that Athens was conquered.

![The Long Walls of the 5th Century BC.](images/long_walls.jpg)

Our ferries came and went from Piraeus, but we had lunch next to Zea. Zea is now full of pleasure boats.

Then we dragged our stuff back to the port to sit around on the ground and await our ferry. It eventually came, and we were on our way to Santorini!

## Interlude 9. Heraklion–Munich: October 28–29

> We planned our 2024 trip through Greece with breaks throughout, during which we could stay in apartments and live semi-normal lives for a few days between multi-day hikes. [Trekking Hellas](https://trekking.gr) hikes are extremely well-organized and the hotels are always comfortable and hospitable, but it is tiring to move from place to place every night, and keeping up with laundry can be a challenge.

All things come to an end, and at the end of October, it was time to go home. For whatever reason, I couldn't get us home from Heraklion to Charlotte on the same day. The only flight to Munich left in the evening. We had to spend a night in Germany on the way back.

Our last morning in Kavousi, we fed our porch kitties, cleaned up, and then headed south toward Ierapetra. 

![We were sorry to leave our view of the mountains looming over Kavousi!](images/kavousi_clouds_mountain3.MP4)

That would let us drive along some more of the south coast of Crete and then cut north toward Heraklion, touring more of central Crete in the process. Approaching Heraklion from the south would bring us right past Knossos, which I thought we should visit.

![A last look at the south coast of Crete.](images/IMG_4449.jpg)

The drive was pretty, to be sure. But Knossos? No dice. On October 28, hardly high season, the parking lot was mobbed and the sides of the roads were parked up. I remember visiting the place in 1990. I took a bus from central Heraklion. There were other tourists at the site, but nothing resembling a mob. There certainly weren't hordes of rental cars in a giant parking lot, or masses of tour buses. 

Knossos hasn't gotten bigger. 

We decided we didn't need to visit Knossos after all.

Instead, we drove back east on the coastal highway to the first coastal town with beach frontage we saw. We got off in Kokkini Hani and had a final stroll along the beach. It was finally starting to feel like autumn.

![There were STILL tourists swimming in these waves! Must've been Germans.](images/Heraklion_waves_IMG_4487.MOV)

We had a last seafood lunch at To Kyma. They had the best [keftedakia](https://realgreekrecipes.com/keftedakia/)!

![Which fish should I pick?](images/Heraklion_which_fish_IMG_4478.jpg)

![A last look at the Mediterranean](images/Heraklion_last_lunch_IMG_4481.jpg)

And then it was time to head to the airport. Turning in the rental car doesn't bear describing; suffice it to say, it was not intuitive, but we either successfully returned it, or handed it over to a car-thief and the rental company never followed up. 

Checking in for our flight was likewise stressful. According to the [Telegraph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/), Heraklion Airport is [the worst airport in Europe](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/heraklion-airport-crete-worst-in-world/). I suspect this is largely the result of Crete's tourist industry having grown exponentially in the past few years, and that the awfulness is largely seasonal. We certainly didn't have any difficulty with it when we flew back to Athens in 2023. 

But. There is certainly room for improvement. The ladies' room had some issue with the toilets--tourists apparently can't learn not to throw toilet paper in the toilets (you can't put toilet paper in the toilets in Greece!!!!), which doesn't do great things to the plumbing functionality.

The check-in procedure is the usual chaotic European thing, where individual flights check in at specific desks. You can't check in before the airline decides it's time, and then everyone checks in at once. In a mob. Fortunately, Germans (we were on Lufthansa) are fairly organized about these things, and most of our fellow travelers seemed to have the attitude that the Greeks weren't going to be organized so they would be. 

Then there are the gates. There are not enough seats for all the passengers waiting to board. This creates more chaos and confusion, though the shopping area is quite attractive, so wandering around on foot isn't so bad. 

In any case, we all ended up on board the plane. The flight to Munich was uneventful though it was absolutely packed.

Our bags were checked through to Charlotte, so all we had to do was walk out the airport with our backpacks. I'd gotten us a room at a Radisson near the airport. We had to take a cab--walking is NOT a possibility--which cost us €25 for a nine-minute ride. I don't know if this is some airport pricing thing or if all cabs in Germany now cost €3 a minute. I hope not!

The rest of the trip home went as well as can be expected. After another €25 euro cab ride the next morning, we were back at the terminal. Our flight to Charlotte was utterly full. We'd cleverly selected aisle seats on either side of a center section three rows from the back of the plane, thinking that no one would willingly choose the remaining middle seat. But when the plane is full, someone ends up in that seat, willing or not. We discovered that we were sitting on either side of a man who never once got up the entire flight.

And then we were in Charlotte! Global Entry worked better than it ever has--the agent just waved us through. Charlotte baggage claim was slow as always. Our good friend Pat Kennedy was waiting to drive us home, bless him. One stop on the way to Greenville, at a Waffle House.

And we were back.




## Trip Logistics

> We planned our 2024 trip through Greece with breaks throughout, during which we could stay in apartments and live semi-normal lives for a few days between multi-day hikes. [Trekking Hellas](https://trekking.gr) hikes are extremely well-organized and the hotels are always comfortable and hospitable, but it is tiring to move from place to place every night, and keeping up with laundry can be a challenge.

> So every week or two, we'd stop someplace, live in a house, and catch our breaths. We picked our break locations for geographic convenience, historical interest, and nostalgia. These interludes were just as much a part of the trip as the hikes. 

### Lodging 

I had several requirements for Air BnBs:

- They had to have at least two bedrooms. We both need our space! 
- They had to have washing machines. (No one in Greece has a dryer.) 
- They had to have parking spaces if we had a car at the time. 
- They had to be close to something--a town, a grocery store, sites we wanted to see.

Fortunately, we had no trouble finding lovely accommodations everywhere we stayed, and for extremely reasonable prices. For this situation, we have a demographic transition to thank. Greece's retirees tend to be hale, hearty, and have useful home maintenance skills. Its younger generation is Internet-savvy, proficient in English, and keenly interested in monetizing family properties. Everywhere we went, a youngish person would serve as our main online contact, but we were greeted by their parents. Parents do the cleaning and prep, and in many cases, they appear also to have done much of the construction required to bring these properties into the modern era so that they can meet the expectations of foreign tourists.

And they've done a great job shoehorning modern amenities into properties that weren't built with multiple bathrooms and electric appliances in mind. Every property had air conditioning (far from guaranteed a couple of decades ago). Every property had wifi (of varying effectiveness, but there nevertheless). Every place even had a fancy coffee maker. The fact that every single one also had some weirdness (a four-floor walkup and only one key to the exterior door; super steep interior stairs; strange ancient blankets and a washing machine in the bathroom that had to be plugged in outside the bathroom door; wifi that looked strong but that didn't actually work at all) just helped to keep us humble in the eyes of the gods.

### Ferries

Book your tickets online. It is easy. You get a "boarding pass" that you can either show the guys in your email, or load into your Wallet on your phone. We never had the slightest problem, whether on the fancy Blue Star overnight ferries or on the modest coastal ferries in Crete.

### Driving

Mainland Greece has a really excellent system of national roads, which closely resemble U.S. Interstate highways. The main difference is that these are toll roads. 

Every few kilometers, traffic must stop to pay a toll. There are dedicated lanes for buses and trucks and commercial vehicles with passes. Everyone else goes through the pay-as-you-go lanes, paying either by cash or by credit card. We ended up keeping a credit card in the console between the front seats to have it on hand every few minutes. The tolls can add up, which might be why the national highways are so empty.

Because the national highways are toll roads, exits are limited. There are, however, regular truck stops on the side of the road where people can fuel up their cars and grab a meal or snacks. These are nicely organized and well-stocked and generally very easy to use.

**All gas stations are full-service.** Pull up to the pump, and the guy will come out. You need to say what you want, but "Benzini, Fill" works. "Benzene" (βενζίνη) means "gasoline". You pay with a card right at the pump.

![A gas stop on the A2](images/A2_truck_stop_IMG_1494.jpg)

We only encountered these toll roads on the mainland. Neither Rhodes nor Crete has anything like them, though Crete's northern highway has been modernized to a four-lane divided highway in a few places. 

Off the superhighways, there are a range of roads, ranging from multi-lane city thoroughfares to narrow, winding country roads that pass right through tiny towns, where they serve as simultaneous regional highways, town roads, and parking areas. These situations require patience and willingness to compromise. 

Parking tends to be casual. If there's space on the side of a road, it generally seems to be fine to park there. Supermarkets have parking lots, but otherwise you can't count on a business to have its own parking. This applies to hotels as well. 

Carplay navigation usually works well, though our phones would lose signal in the mountains. When plugged in, Amy's phone would sometimes drop Maps and start playing Prokofiev's *Peter and the Wolf* for reasons that we never discerned. Only our Skoda even had Carplay, so this strange bug wasn't relevant in Rhodes or Crete.

### Rental Cars

We ended up renting three different cars. First, we rented a very nice car in Thessaloniki to use throughout mainland Greece. We just parked it at the start of our two multi-day hiking trips and collected it at the end. Trekking Hellas recommended that strategy; it's difficult (maybe impossible?) to reach some of our starting points with public transportation, and though car transfers are always possible, they'd have cost as much as renting for the whole time. 

Skoda is a Czech brand owned by Volkswagen since 2000. Consensus on Reddit is that Skoda isn't a luxury brand *per se*, but that it does make high-quality cars on the higher end of the consumer market. We found this Skoda very comfortable and Chris enjoyed driving it. It had plenty of power! It also probably made us look German.

On the other hand, this car was by far the most expensive one we had in Greece. It was big and nice and pretty new, and we paid for the highest level of insurance. I'm not sure that was strictly necessary, but Chris didn't want to take any chances with this one. 

We relinquished the Skoda in Athens the day we caught our ferry to Rhodes. This required driving to the Athens airport. First, we had to refuel as close to our return as possible; this involved driving around the airport perimeter past the Ikea and other big box stores and almost getting stuck in the back parking area of an Exxon--mildly stressful. Then we had to figure out which parking lot to drive into. We tried the lot just past the Sofitel where we've stayed several times--and as luck would have it, that was exactly right! An agent met us instantly, declared the car in perfect condition, and we were on our way. 

We hadn't intended to rent another car until our last week in Crete, but ended up making a spur-of-the-moment decision to rent a [Toyota Avgo](https://www.toyota.co.uk/new-cars/aygo-x?srsltid=AfmBOopSVSPxH0TrTLVUTi09pIaWSLj-2U65ZWWlGqcKET0az93EvFeP) for a couple of days in Rhodes. This was due to a more-or-less complete lack of transportation options near our AirBnB, but it also gave us the opportunity to do a driving tour of the entire island--a great way to revisit the places we'd been throughout our stay.

The Avgo was our worst car. By far! It was small and janky, it had no air conditioning, and the clutch was mushy. The brakes weren't great, but that was okay because it had no power. On our tour of the countryside, we regularly collected followers on the uphills. But it did the job. And it cost under €100, a great deal.

Chris had booked the Skoda ahead of time from a national car rental agency. We'd reserved a car in Chania, Crete, but ended up canceling that reservation on the thinking that we'd do better just getting one from an agency in town. Our Cretan guide Yannis hooked us up with a local agency right on the corner of the pedestrian tourist area. 

There we collected a blue Volkswagen Polo that definitely wasn't brand new but was really fine. We rented it for six days for about €270. The Polo was somewhere in between the high-end Skoda and the janky Avgo.
