# Crete White Mountains and Coastal Trail, September 12–19, 2024

— Amy G. Hackney Blackwell, with Christopher Blackwell

In mid-October, we went to Crete. 

We spent our first ten days or so in western Crete, hiking in the mountains and along the southern coastline. 

We combined two of Trekking Hellas's itineraries to maximize our coverage of southwest Crete. First, we did the [Hiking in the White Mountains (Self-Guided)](https://trekking.gr/en/excursions/hiking-in-the-white-mountains-of-crete-self-guided) trek. Then we added on the last two days of [Coastal treks in Crete (E4)](https://trekking.gr/en/excursions/coastal-treks-in-crete-e4). That gave us a really good sense of the geography of the area. 

Short version: Crete is rocky and rough! Crete is also kind of scary. 

If any geological feature distinguishes Crete, it is the gorge. The entire island appears to be in the process of breaking apart into a dozen separate pieces, with gorges forming the breaks between them. Gorges have very steep sides.

I do not do well with exposure—not "exposure" in the sense of "being cold and wet", but in the sense of standing near sheer drops on one side of a trail. I especially hate exposure combined with narrow, dusty trails that are angled downhill. Crete is the only place in Greece where exposure was an issue for us. It's a steep place!

Also: southern Crete is hard to navigate. When we booked our trip, we had no idea that certain portions of the transport would have to be by boat. Sections of the south coast have no roads. Certain towns are served entirely by ferry boats that sail east and west. The mountain roads themselves are no picnic to drive. This definitely adds to the cost of travel there.

That being said, we love Crete. It's beautiful, the food is great, and the people are both friendly and chill. 

## October 12: SeaJets Santorini–Rethymno and on to Chania

![The ferry route is a straight shot south-southwest from Santorini to Crete.](images/map_ferry_to_crete.jpg)

We left Santorini on a Saturday afternoon and cruised into the port of Rethymno well after dark, though only an hour or so behind schedule. Our [Welcome Pickups](https://www.welcomepickups.com) driver, Kyriakis (it means "Sunday") was waiting for us to drive us an hour west to Chania. 

One thing about the Greek economy--it's brutal to young people. Kyriakis is an engineer with a job at a renewable energy company, but he finds it (considerably) more lucrative to drive tourists around Crete. Even with Crete's arcane taxi rules (all his fares must either start or end in Chania), joining forces with his dad's taxi company and spending a fair amount of downtime either driving to a pickup (he had to drive from Chania to Rethymno to collect us) or waiting for late pickups to materialize (our ferry was delayed) is much more likely to result in consistently reliable income than a professional job. 

Kyriakis speaks English with a near-BBC accent, the result of a childhood spent listening to audiobooks of Tolkein and J.K. Rowling. He's lived in Chania his whole life and speaks of it with deep affection. He gave us a list of things to be sure to experience in Chania and Crete:

1. We should eat at Syntrophia, home of the best souvlaki in Chania.

1. We should eat seafood at Manos, on the waterfront in the Nea Chora beachfront neighborhood of Chania.

1. We should get galataboureko at Perathorakis bakery, just around the corner from Manos.

1. We should try a *sfakia ni pita*, a great delicacy from the town of Chora Sfakion on the south coast.

We were to follow all of these recommendations, each of which proved sound. 

The first one we followed was the suggestion to find Syntrophia that very night, right after we checked into the hotel around 9:00 p.m.. Syntrophia is a hole-in-the-wall souvlaki joint run by a man and what appears to be his mother. There's nothing fancy there; the sign isn't even in English. We sat at a table on the narrow sidewalk next to a bank of motor scooters that doordash drivers used for their deliveries. But the souvlaki definitely hit the spot. Even the hot dogs that are evidently part of a combo platter….

![This was the SMALL souvlaki plate!](images/Chania_souvlaki_IMG_3407.jpg)

## October 13: Chania

We'd wanted a day to explore Chania before setting off on our hikes. In retrospect, maybe we didn't need it; Chania is so touristed up these days, there's very little interesting about it. The one thing Chris actually wanted to see--the Maritime Museum--was closed on Sunday. Maybe we were just peevish from two days in Santorini.

No matter! The waterfront is always pretty, and the weather was balmy. A relaxing Sunday wasn't a terrible prospect. 

![Old Town waterfront](images/Chania_old_town_waterfront_IMG_3409.MOV)

We made our way over to Nea Chora, "new place", a little harbor just to the west of the main Old Town one. Nea Chora a popular place for local families to eat seafood on weekend afternoons. 

![Nea Chora, Chania](images/Chania_Nea_Chora_IMG_3434.jpg)

![A boat named "Psychotherapy"](images/Chania_psychotherapy_IMG_3427.jpg)

We located [Manos](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189415-d3161852-Reviews-Manos-Chania_Town_Chania_Prefecture_Crete.html), easy to find because of its massive tables full of family groups ordering their Sunday lunches. We did likewise. 

![Chris was happy to have lunch!](images/Chania_Sunday_lunch_IMG_3430.jpg)

![One page of the extensive menu at Manos](images/Chania_Manos_menu_IMG_3429.jpg)

Kyriakis had been very clear about what we needed to order. We should get boiled octopus, marinated anchovies, mixed vegetables, and definitely barbouni (red mullet). But we also wanted a horiatiki, and Chris wanted to try [fava](https://mysweetgreek.com/recipes/greek-fava-yellow-split-pea-puree-recipe/), the yellow split pea purée. The portions are clearly intended for groups of at least six, more likely eight or ten. Seafood restaurants aimed at a local market don't deal in tiny portions of anything.

We ended up compromising. We got the marinated anchovies, but not the boiled octopus. We had enough vegetables with our massive salad. 

![Anchovies plus a massive horiatiki! The cheese is mizithra instead of feta, a Cretan convention.](images/Chania_Manos_horiatiki_IMG_3431.jpg)

For the barbouni, I asked if we might, just possibly, have a half portion. This unusual request had to go all the way to Manos himself, but he graciously approved it.

![A half-portion of barbouni along with split pea puree.](images/Chania_Manos_barbouni_IMG_3436.jpg)

It's days like this that I really miss my massive New Orleans extended family. We never lacked for participants at Sunday dinners. Dining this way as a couple feels woefully inadequate.

![This meal with our friends in Gavalou is much more Greek style!](images/Nafpaktos_lunch_IMG_1516.jpg)

After this massive lunch, we hardly needed dessert, but I do love galataboureko, and Kyriakis had assured us that Perathorakis made the best galataboureko in the known universe. There was the small matter that he insisted that they sold this confection only by the tray, and we had no idea what we'd do with an entire tray of Greek custard pie, but we thought we'd figure it out when we got there.

After a few minutes of wandering around the area just south of the Nea Chora waterfront, not especially helped by Apple Maps (which claimed the bakery was in a place where it clearly was not) and by my guess at the spelling of the name (entirely phonetic), we found it--[Perathorakis](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189415-d10458506-Reviews-Perathorakis_Pastry_Shop-Chania_Town_Chania_Prefecture_Crete.html)

As it turned out, they make tiny galataboureko bites in addition to full trays. This was ideal! We bought two, ate them on the spot, and agreed that they were indeed contenders for the title of best galataboureko ever.

The rest of the day we took easy. Our local contact from Trekking Hellas, Eleni, met us at the hotel that evening to go over details of our hike. (When a Cretan guide says that they don't hike a certain section of trail because "it's very exposed," pay attention--and be prepared for at least some of the acceptable sections to be mildly hair-raising!) 

![The evening view from our hotel, plus a car alarm.](images/Chania_view_from_hotel_IMG_3438.MOV)

We went out for a bit to stroll around the Old Town. We bought traditional Cretan knives for the kids. We got ice cream. 

In need of no more food that day, we retired to our hotel. There, we watched the OG *Carrie*, with Sissy Spacek and John Travolta. Groovy!

## Crete White Mountains. October 14: Agia Irini Gorge and Omalos

![Map of Agia Irini and environs](images/Agia_Irini_map_IMG_3447.jpg)

This morning was the beginning of our first Cretan trek, Trekking Hellas's [Hiking in the White Mountains of Crete](https://trekking.gr/en/excursions/hiking-in-the-white-mountains-of-crete-self-guided). Today we began with a relatively short and easy hike: Agia Irini Gorge. This was both to give us a warmup and to account for the two full hours of car transfers that were involved in getting us to our hike and thence to our accommodation.

![Topographic map of the trail.](images/irini_topo.jpg)

![Stats for our walk.](images/irini_stats.jpg)

![All downhill!](images/irini_elevation.jpg)

Our driver, Yannis, picked us up for the hour-long drive to the gorge. This started to give us an inkling of why Trekking Hellas's Cretan holidays are so much more expensive than the ones in mainland Greece: transportation in Crete is difficult. Yannis works for a company called [Sougia Taxi](https://sougiataxi-meletis.gr), based in the south coast town of Sougia. He had to drive about 90 minutes to meet us at our hotel, then drive back south to the gorge. After he dropped us off, he had to drive around to the end of the trail so he'd be in position to pick us up when we emerged 3 or 4 hours later. Then he had to drive us to Omalos, the town on the high plateau that's the closest settlement to the top of the much more famous Samaria Gorge. Then he'd still be a good hour from getting back to Sougia--a long workday for him.

Anyway! Yannis got us to the trailhead. There were a couple of tavernas set up there exclusively to serve trekking customers; there's no town there. 

![This café is named after the famous Kri-Kri, the indigenous Cretan wild goat.](images/Agia_Irini_cafe_sign_IMG_3448.jpg)

We grabbed a coffee at a taverna so we could also use the restroom, and then we headed off into our first gorge.

![The start of the trail through Agia Irini Gorge](images/Agia_Irini_trailhead_IMG_3446.jpg) 

There were lots of rocks, as one would expect. There were also lots of goats.

![Goats! These are not, however, kri-kri.](images/Agia_Irini_goats_IMG_3452.MOV)

![Goats drinking water.](images/Agia_Irini_goats_drinking_IMG_3459.MOV)

![A little shrine in the rocks.](images/Agia_Irini_shrine_IMG_3460.jpg)

Chris flew the drone some; this looked like an ideal place to have it follow us. Alas, this drone apparently can't see pine trees all that well.

![A broken propellor blade after a run-in with a tree, easily repaired.](images/Agia_Irini_drone_busted_IMG_3461.jpg)

Eleni had told us that this trail would be fairly simple, though it would involve some "scrambling". We never know what people mean by that; my assumption would be that it refers to terrain that requires the use of hands and that can't just be walked over. 

![Is this "scrambling"?](images/Agia_Irini_scrambling_IMG_3468.MOV)

![This looks like a fossilized fungus.](images/Agia_Irini_fossil_IMG_3474.jpg)

We emerged at the far end of the gorge around noon. All in all, it was an extremely pleasant walk, all the gorge scenery with none of the desperate crowds that can fill Samaria Gorge. In fact, some hotels will recommend Agia Irini Gorge to visitors who can't do Samaria.

![A sign to the café at the end of the gorge.](images/Agia_Irini_end_IMG_3480.jpg)

Yannis had instructed us to call him when we were ready to get picked up. (He was waiting somewhere nearby, but not at the trail-end cafe.) As he warned us, our phones didn't work there, but the café let us use their phone.

![Tiny café puppy!](images/Agia_Irini_cafe_puppy_IMG_3482.MOV)

Our accommodations this evening were in the town of [Omalos](https://travelertina.blog/2022/06/19/staying-in-omalos/), which is barely a town; it's just a farming settlement high on the Omalos plateau that happens to be located quite near the top of the Samaria Gorge. Tour buses regularly stop here to disgorge hikers, and there are about three hotels and restaurants to serve the overnight crowd.

![Omalos plateau.](images/Omalos_plateau_IMG_3500.jpg)

NB: Omalos is 35 km from Chania. That's like 22 miles. But it takes a solid hour to drive there from Chania. That is totally normal in Greece, where the shortest distances can take forever to cover, either by car or on foot.

At over 1000 meters in elevation, Omalos has a completely different climate from the coasts. As had happened when we entered the mountains of Arkadia a month earlier, we discovered that we had passed from summer well into autumn. (We walked back into summer two days later, heading south through the Samaria Gorge.)

The staff at the [Hotel Neos Omalos](https://www.neos-omalos.gr) were fielding questions from a group of Germans who had traveled there intending to hike the Samaria Gorge the next day. But the gorge was going to be closed! The staff was recommending alternatives, to wit the Agia Irini Gorge (like I said…) or the ascent of Mt. Giglios. That was our agenda for tomorrow!

I ate goat for lunch. It was delicious!

## Crete White Mountains. October 15: Mt. Gingilos (or Gigilos)

![The Mt. Giglios hike. We made it about half way.](images/giglios_map.jpg)

![Stats for the Giglios hike.](images/giglios_stats.jpg)

![Walking high above Samaria Gorge.](images/Gigilos_above_gorge_IMG_3563.MOV)

Neos Omalos Hotel runs morning shuttles to the Samaria Gorge trailhead, which is also the Mt. Gigilos trailhead. You sign your name on the list for the shuttle you want the day before, and then after breakfast, you hop on the van for the ten-minute ride. The gorge was closed today, so the van was fairly empty. 

As we drove past sheep fields,  Chris observed that many of the sheep had red paint on their backs. This is a [technique](https://vethelpdirect.com/vetblog/2021/09/29/why-do-sheep-have-paint-on-them/#google_vignette) shepherds use to identify which ewes have been… uh… serviced. The shepherd paints the ram's chest or outfits him with a dye bag that hangs down his sternum. When the ram visits a ewe, he leaves his mark behind. Red ram was clearly an energetic fellow….

Mt. Gigilos is situated just above Samaria Gorge. Its summit is 1980 meters, and reportedly offers a view of both the Aegean and the Libyan Seas, as well as a birds-eye view of the Samaria Gorge. It's allegedly the most accessible summit in Crete, requiring no more than "a little scrambling" and no actual mountaineering equip.m.ent or skills. 

![Mt. Gigilos.](images/Gigilos_IMG_3489.jpg)

However. Mountain walks can be rough, especially once you get above the tree line into the grey scree-field domain. The higher you go up a mountain, the steeper the walking surface tends to get. I do not do well with edges, and steep ascents terrify me. I hate walking on scree. 

![It seems to be genetic. My brother and sister were even more scared than I was at Macchu Picchu.](images/Macchu_Picchu_DSC_0416.JPG)

Photos of Mt. Gigilos resemble some of the [scarier Alpine passes](https://www.alisonchino.com/sefinenfurgge-pass/) we've crossed. 

![The Sefinafurgge, on the Via Alpina in Switzerland. Steep up, steep down, loose scree, and so very high! I momentarily considered staying there forever just so I wouldn't have to face climbing back down.](images/Sefinafurge_IMG_7879.jpg)

I'd spent much of the previous afternoon doom-scrolling [blogs](https://www.west-crete.com/gingilos.htm) describing the climb up Gigilos, and had mentally prepared myself to be scared out of my wits. Comments like [this](https://www.summitpost.org/gingilos/225306) didn't help: "Danger! After the saddle towards peak there is a very deep and dangerous chasm (precipice). Lot of people died there as they didn't see the dark hole of the chasm."

But! It was our hike, and fortunately it's an out-and-back. We could turn around whenever.

Maybe that wasn't the best mindset for achieving the summit, but on the other hand, we never set out to climb mountains!

The café at the Samaria Gorge trailhead was closed for the low season, or perhaps because the gorge was closed. So we just started climbing.

![Samaria Gorge is a no-drone zone.](images/Gigilos_no_drones_IMG_3487.jpg)

![The trail up Gigilos is part of the extensive E4 coastal trail.](images/Gigilos_E4_IMG_3499.jpg)

From the outset, the trail was rocky—probably the rockiest terrain we'd ever encountered, with the possible exception of some interminable boulder fields in the Alps.

![Rocks everywhere.](images/Gigilos_rocky_trail_IMG_3495.jpg)

![So pleasant underfoot!](images/Gigilos_Amy_rocks_IMG_2835.jpg)

The view was spectacular, no denying that. We could see the Omalos plateau and down into the Samaria Gorge. We even saw a couple of [lammergeiers](https://peregrinefund.org/explore-raptors-species/vultures/bearded-vulture), or maybe one lammergeier twice.

![Omalos plateau](images/Omalos_plateau_IMG_3500.jpg)

![Up above Samaria Gorge](images/Gigilos_view_Samaria_IMG_3533.jpg)

As we got higher, the trail started to feel more exposed. The footing did not get easier. 

![Starting to feel it….](images/giglios_exposed.mp4)

When we got to [the famous arch](https://www.walkingenglishman.com/europe09.html#google_vignette), I'd had enough. 

![The arch](images/Gigilos_arch_IMG_3540.jpg)

The trail through the arch was steep and narrow and loose, there was an edge to the left, and the reward for traversing that section was a scree field and some steep switchbacks. After which things would get really hairy! 

Also, every step that we walked up we would have to walk down.

![Chris did a little scouting and agreed that this trail would not be to my liking.](images/Arch_Chris_IMG_3544.MOV)

We wanted time to fly the drone anyway.

![Mt. Gigilos is not a no-drone zone!](images/Gigilos_drone_IMG_3550.jpg)

![On the side of the mountai, near the famous arch.](images/Giglios_zoomy.MP4)

As predicted, the walk down was just as tricky as the walk up. We picked our way down, getting back to the parking lot around 1:00. One of the girls from the hotel came and collected us. 

![Back down we go!](images/Giglios_walking_trimmed.mp4)

![Waiting for our pickup](images/Omalos_sheep_IMG_3600.MOV)

We spent the rest of the day kicking around Omalos and relaxing, which wasn't terrible.

Especially because tomorrow the [Samaria Gorge](https://www.visitgreece.gr/experiences/nature/gorges/samaria-gorge/) would be open!

![There are lots of sheep in Omalos.](images/Omalos_sheep_IMG_3600.MOV)

## Crete White Mountains. October 16: Samaria Gorge and Agia Roumeli

![Samaria Gorge is up through that notch.](images/Samaria_from_sea_IMG_4006.jpg)

![Map of the Samaria Gorge hike. You can see the Giglios trail (what we did of it) at the upper-left.](images/samaria_map.jpg)

![Stats for the hike. *Not* necessarily an easy day-walk for](images/samaria_stats.jpg)

Today we hiked the Samaria Gorge! Despite the gorge being pretty much universally closed all month, including the days before and after we did it, as our luck had it, it was open the very day we'd scheduled to walk it back in January.

Short version: it was fun! No problems whatsoever. We started at 8:00, were sitting at the café at the end by 1:30, and had plenty of time to enjoy our afternoon.

But there's a lot to say about the Samaria Gorge.

### Why is it closed all the time?

I've mentioned several times that the [Samaria Gorge](https://samaria-gorge.gr/#google_vignette) had been closed. That had happened when we'd visited Crete the previous spring--the gorge was closed due to bad weather or something. This particular week there was no explanation. But there are some good reasons why this place--the biggest tourist attraction in western Crete--is fairly frequently closed to the public.

The main reason is that it's dangerous. Like, actually dangerous. 

First, it's geologically unstable, which means rocks fall off the walls, [especially after hard rains](https://www.argophilia.com/news/samaria-gorge-profit-over-safety/236394/). Just a month before we visited, [a German tourist was killed](https://www.ekathimerini.com/news/1248856/remaining-hikers-exit-mountain-gorge-in-crete-closed-after-tourists-death/) by a rock that fell after a rainstorm. 

More disturbing to us, it's a firetrap. The terrain is dry much of the year, and there is no motorized transportation inside. A number of (very brave and strong-looking!) firefighters patrol the gorge and keep an eye on their water bags and hose systems, but I wouldn't trust anyone's chances if a real wildfire broke out in there. 

It can also be [very hot](https://sougiataxi-meletis.gr/taxi-articles/samaria-gorge-closes-due-to-extreme-heatwave/) in the summer. Like, dangerously hot, which can only be exacerbated by the wall-to-wall summer crowds. A river does run through it, and there are springs here and there, but there's no drinking water available in most parts.

So although the Samaria Gorge is a vital source of income for southwestern Crete, and some 250,000 tourists pay to enter it every year, the authorities do regularly close it.

### NOT a walk in the park!

Though every hotel in Chania, Rethymno, and Heraklion sells a day trip to the gorge, Samaria Gorge is actually quite a difficult hike. It's ten miles (16 km) from start to finish, which is a long way to walk in one shot. It's far from the hardest trail in Crete, but it's hard enough; there are plenty of rocks to jump over and rough crossings to sprain ankles. Attempting this in anything but sensible outdoor walking shoes is a fool's errand. (Oh, and the initial staircase is very slippery, the rocks having been worn smooth by decades of feet.)

There's no motorized transport inside. That means if you get hurt or sick and can't continue, the only rescue is on the back of a mule, or perhaps on a stretcher carried by two burly pyrosvestis firefighters. Not even helicopters can reach most of the terrain.

Then there are the [logistics](https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/samaria-gorge-crete/index.html). The uphill trailhead at Xyloscalo (staircase) is only 25 miles from Chania, but it takes a good hour to drive there. For reasons that will become clear in a moment, it's not generally practical to leave a car at this trailhead expecting to get back to it that afternoon. Most tourists get dropped off as part of an organized trip, often a bus excursion or with a private guide.

If you walk from the mountains to the sea (the downhill route), you come out in the town of Agia Roumeli on the coast of the Libyan Sea. (You can't see Libya from Crete, but it's down there.) Agia Roumeli has no cars. 

No cars???? But… then how do you get back to Chania (or Rethymno, or Heraklion)? 

Well… by ferry, and then by bus. Two ferries leave Agia Roumeli around 5 p.m.. One sails west to Sougia, and one sails east to Chora Sfakion. In either of those places, our weary tourists board another bus, which drives them another 90 minutes or so back to their accommodations on the north coast. 

This makes for a very long day outing. The morning pickups can be around 6:00 a.m. or even earlier to make the trailhead by 8:00 or so. Tourists return to their hotels around 7:30, 8:00, or possibly even later.

The ferry schedule creates its own stress. Young and fit people start popping out the south end around 1:00 p.m.. They make their way to the town of Agia Roumeli, where they can relax on the (black sand) beach or while away the afternoon (i.e., get their drink on) at a seaside taverna. The slower walkers, on the other hand, must find the time pressure stressful indeed. If they miss the ferry, they're probably stuck in Agia Roumeli until the next day.

Can you bail? Sort of… Most people walk north to south, which is the downhill direction. That means if someone decides early on that they can't manage the full distance and that it would be better to return to the trailhead, they have to turn around and walk straight uphill. 

Our friend Yannis told us about a family he'd privately guided through the gorge. The mom and teenage sons were all gung-ho and eager to hike the gorge. Dad, on the other hand, maybe wasn't in the best of shape. He made it to the bottom of the initial staircase, but  it became clear that he was not going to do well on a nine-mile walk over rocks. It was decided that dad and Yannis would return to the trailhead while the mom and kids would do the hike. They agreed to meet up in Sougia that evening. 

Yannis physically assisted his guest all the way up the staircase. At the top, they had to call a taxi to drive them to Sougia (an expensive and long trip!) Though it all worked out and the wife and kids had a lovely day, that afternoon sitting at a beachside taverna awaiting his family, the dad confessed that sitting on the beach was the trip he'd actually envisioned.

Oh, and there aren't many restrooms. Like, very very few. Like… maybe one? There might be more, but we only saw one, and it had quite a line. Off-trail refreshment is discouraged and, in any case, privacy is severely lacking.

So although Samaria Gorge is sold as a must-do experience, and though it is indeed pretty cool to see, it's not something to be taken lightly. If an extremely long day of walking on rough terrain (perhaps in crowds that rival those in Disneyworld) and riding on boats and buses isn't your idea of a good time, maybe give it a miss. (Try Agia Irini instead, maybe? It's much more relaxed, shorter, and no more complicated to get to.)

An alternative is to go to Agia Roumeli through other means (ground transport plus ferry) and walk UP the gorge some distance. It's possible of course to go all the way to Omalos, but it would be pleasant enough just to walk as far as the famous Gates and then head back. Vacations shouldn't be stressful!

### Our own hike

This day started early. We meant to start early anyway, but the previous evening the hotel had suddenly informed us that our suitcases needed to be ready to go by 7:30 so they could get to Sougia in time to be put on the morning ferry to Agia Roumeli. Of course….

So we had breakfast at 7:00, dropped our suitcases at the door, and then boarded the 7:45 shuttle--no reason not to get an early start on the gorge!

![The day started autumnal and windy! That didn't last, though. You can see Mt. Gigilos in the background.](images/Samaria_sign_morning_IMG_3604.jpg)

![Everyone has to buy a ticket to enter the gorge and relinquish it at the far end. That's how the staff makes sure everyone is out at the end of the day.](images/Samaria_tickets_IMG_3601.jpg)

![The start of the hike is a long descent down a rocky staircase. The rocks are worn smooth, which makes them slippery--this is probably the most dangerous part of the hike.](images/Samaria_staircase_IMG_3606.jpg)

![The bottom of the gorge is rocky.](images/Samaria_rocky_bottom_IMG_3612.jpg)

The Samaria gorge was an inspiration to geologists in the early days of the field, and you can really see why. The history of the land is written right in the rocks.

![Strata, or layers, which give us the study of stratigraphy.](images/Samaria_layers_IMG_3619.jpg)

![Evident uplift; look at the diagonal tilting!](images/Samaria_uplift_IMG_3629.jpg)

![Toward the south end of the gorge are the ruins of the old town of Agia Roumeli.](images/Samaria_ruins_IMG_3636.jpg)

The width of the gorge varies. In some places it's quite wide. The narrowest bits are toward the south.

![It really looks like a canyon here!](images/Samaria_canyon_IMG_3652.JPG)

![The walking is rough. It really wouldn't be ideal for someone who struggles with balance.](images/Samaria_walking_IMG_3659.MOV)

The most famous bit of the gorge is the [Gates](https://www.muchbetteradventures.com/magazine/samaria-gorge-crete-history/), or Iron Gates, which are about 3 meters wide. This must be quite the logjam on busy days in the summer!

![Though there are some narrow bits that you might think are the Gates, it's a safe assumption that the money shot of the whole site will have a sign.](images/Samaria_gates_sign_IMG_3689.jpg)

![Approaching the Gates from the north.](images/Samaria_approaching_gatesIMG_3688.jpg)

![And looking back from the south.](images/Samaria_gates_from_south_IMG_3697.jpg)

At the end of the official Gorge trail, tourists hand over their tickets and then exit to a collection of cafés. We made it there by about 1:30.

![We watched a couple of lammergeiers flying over the gorge.](images/Samaria_lamergeiers_trimmed.mov)

Refreshed, we headed out to walk the last kilometer to the town of Agia Roumeli. There are vans that will transport you to town for a fee. It didn't seem worth it to pay for such a short drive, though this would be a godsend for people with kids or blisters on their feet.

### Agia Roumeli

![Agia Roumeli. The named “roads” are footpaths.](images/agia_roumeli_map.jpg)

[Agia Roumeli](https://www.agiaroumeli.com) is a very small town on the Libyan Sea. You can't drive there; the only way to get there is to take a ferry from Sougia or Chora Sfakion or to walk there through the gorge. There's [not a heck of a lot to do](https://www.roamfarandwide.com/agia-roumeli-crete-greece/). There's a beach, if you don't mind black, rocky sand.

![Agia Roumeli and the mouth of the Samaria Gorge](images/Agia_Roumeli_IMG_4003.jpg)

![Agia Roumeli's black sand beach](images/Agia_Roumeli_beach_IMG_3722.jpg)

Predictably, hiking is popular. The E4 trail runs both east and west from Agia Roumeli, but Eleni in Chania had told us that they NEVER take tourists on the section between Agia Roumeli and Sougia to the west. It's reportedly very exposed, rough, and downright dangerous. We ourselves would be heading east the next morning.

![Some tourists walk up to the Turkish castle visible on the ridge at top right.](images/Agia_Roumeli_IMG_3719.jpg)

The vast majority of tourists who walk there leave on the afternoon ferry, which makes for lively afternoons but quiet nights.

We had dinner at the restaurant [Rousios](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1753715-d4963309-Reviews-Rousios-Agia_Roumeli_Chania_Prefecture_Crete.html), which lived up to its very good reviews. And the local rosé wine was to die for!

![That special might be the most delicious meal I've ever had!](images/Agia_Roumeli_goat_dish_IMG_3741.jpg)

![We started with a very excellent horiatiki.](images/Agia_Roumeli_horiatiki_IMG_3739.jpg)

The name "Agia Roumeli" is funny. You might think it means "Saint Roumeli," but who was Roumeli? The answer is, no one. "Agia" in this case doesn't mean "holy". The name is thought to be a corruption of the Arab words ["Aia Rumeli,"](https://www.agiaroumeli.com/history.htm) or maybe "Aqua Roumeli," which might mean "Waters of the Romans". "Romans" in this case meaning Greeks. 

It was wonderful to have reached the southern reaches of the Aegean world. Just the name "Libyan Sea" suggests the imminent presence of Africa. 

## Crete White Mountains. October 17: Agia Roumeli–Loutro

![The hike to Loutro, along the coast.](images/to_loutro_map.jpg)

![Stats for the hike. Lots of climbing and descending for "a walk along the shore."](images/loutro_stats.jpg)

We both woke up tired, and Chris had the beginning of a cold. Ah well, there was nothing for it but to strap on our backpacks and start walking east! The route promised glorious views of the ocean. 

![The sign marking the start of the trail from Agia Roumeli to Loutro.](images/Agia_E4_sign_IMG_3743.jpg)

![There were goats!](images/Agia_goats_IMG_3761.MOV)

![This is the E4 at its best—smooth, easy, and a great view.](images/Agia_trail_IMG_3778.MOV)

Oh, but it was hard! 

![The walk goes along this coastline.](images/Agia_to_Loutro_coast_IMG_3994.jpg)

![The walk to Agios Pavlos was downhill through deep, soft sand. Which we had to climb back up after visiting the beach!](images/Agia_Agios_Pavlos_IMG_3788.jpg)

After Agios Pavlos beach and taverna, the trail climbed. And climbed.

![Two ferries passing.](images/Agia_ferries_passing_IMG_3800.jpg)

![A view back to Agia Roumeli. Just look at that blue water!](images/Agia_view_back_IMG_3822.MOV)

![Looking down is only a little scary here, but you probably wouldn't want to fall.](images/Agia_a_little_scary_IMG_3832.MOV)

It was beautiful, to be sure, but the sun was strong, and the rocks were unrelenting. Chris nearly ran out of water twice. Maybe we were just tired; some days are like that. 

![The hillside above Marmara](images/Marmara_hillside_IMG_3846.jpg)

We got to the small town of Marmara around 3:00, prime lunchtime in Greece. Eleni had highly recommended the restaurant above Marmara beach, but neither of us felt very hungry. It was just so hot.

Back in Chania, Eleni had warned us against walking the last section of this trail, from Marmara Beach to Loutro. She said "It's very exposed!" The [E4 website](https://www.era-ewv-ferp.org/e-paths/e4/) actually mentions this, and only this, section in its list of E4 sections by country: "Crete from Lykos beach to Marmara beach: the first section (the steep ascent) is very poorly marked and hardly secured; the path hasn’t been checked and renovated for a long time!" [This couple](https://thegenxtravels.com/2023/11/14/a-challenging-hike-in-crete-loutro-to-marmara-beach/) hiked it and didn't love it.

We were more than happy to take Eleni's recommendation to take the boat instead. As it turned out, there was a boat leaving in about 15 minutes. A ten-minute boat ride that deposited us right at a waterside taverna was a great improvement over two more hours of filthy, sunbaked, terrifying clambering over rocks.

But we weren't done climbing! Getting between the taverna and Marmara beach requires descending a marble "staircase" that honestly would make a nice bouldering exercise in a climbing gym. 

Marmara gets its name from the marble that makes up its substrate; the water has worn little caves in the marble blocks at the seaside, which are charming to look at.

![Waiting for the ferry at Marmara.](images/Marmara_waiting_IMG_3849.jpg)

![I took off my shoes while we waited for the ferry. I SAID this was a dirty hike!](images/Marmar_dirty_IMG_3848.jpg)

The ferry was easy enough to negotiate; you just pay €5 per person and get on. Many tourists in the area use these boats all the time for transport from town to town; most folks aren't into hard hiking just to get to a beach.

[Loutro](https://creteinsider.com/1-day-in-loutro-crete/) is another car-free town. It exists mainly to serve the tourism industry; most residents leave in November. 

![Loutro.](images/Loutro_IMG_3856.jpg)

It was lovely to clean up and enjoy a quiet evening.

## Crete White Mountains. October 18–19: Loutro–Chora Sfakia–Sougia

**October 18: Loutro**

Today was a rest day. And we rested! 

![Loutro is the perfect place to do nothing, because there is basically nothing to do.](images/Loutro_boat_IMG_3872.jpg)

Chris slept off his cold. I took a quick dip in the surprisingly cold water; cold freshwater springs enter the sea in this area, making the water cool and clear. We walked up and down the town, which takes about five minutes.

![We could see much of our next hike from the dock.](images/Loutro_route_to_ChoraSfakion_IMG_3870.MOV)

![The ferry docking at Loutro](images/Loutri_ferry_docking.mp4)

![Loutro from the sea](images/Loutro_pan.mp4)

We watched two movies. First, we watched *Caddyshack*, which I now realize doesn't have an actual plot. It's mostly just set pieces that hang together more or less effectively. Then, inspired by Rodney Dangerfield's performance, we watched *Back to School*, which is surprisingly strong. He really was a comedic genius. 

![And rest time is almost over.](images/Loutro_sunset_IMG_3876.jpg)

## October 19: Loutro–Chora Sfakion–Sougia

![The hike to Chora Sfakia.](images/sfakia_map.jpg)

![Stats for the hike.](images/sfakia_stats.jpg)

This morning we had to scramble. It was the ferry situation again.

This was the last day of our [White Mountains](https://trekking.gr/en/excursions/hiking-in-the-white-mountains-of-crete-self-guided) trek. We were going to walk to Chora Sfakion and then catch the afternoon ferry back east to Sougia, where we'd start the [Coastal Trek](https://trekking.gr/en/excursions/coastal-treks-in-crete-e4). Our bags were scheduled to go to Chora Sfakion. We would pick them up there and then haul them to Sougia with us. 

We were sitting at breakfast, enjoying a leisurely morning, when the proprietor informed us that he needed our suitcases in ten minutes. He was going to load them onto his own little boat, to drdive them across the tiny harbor and put them on the morning ferry.

Okay then! We dashed upstairs, flung all our things into our bags, and got them down in time. And then we figured we might as well head out.

![Leaving Loutro, heading east to Chora Sfakion.](images/Loutro_starting_out_IMG_3877.MOV)

![The trail follows the cliffside.](images/Loutro_trail_IMG_3890.jpg)

It was another sunny day. 

![We saw goats.](images/Loutro_goats_IMG_3911.jpg)

We descended (precipitously) to the famous Glyka Nera Beach, aka Sweetwater Beach, so named because of the proponderance of cold freshwater that comes from undergound springs right into the sea. This is a well-known nude beach. 

![Descending to the famous floating taverna. You can't see the nude people, but there are many in the distance.](images/Loutro_sweetwater_IMG_3944.jpg)

![The trail past Glyka Nera is very rocky.](images/Loutro_rocky_trail_IMG_3949.jpg)

The last part of this trail (or the trailhead if you hike west from Chora Sfakion) is notorious for frightening people who are scared of heights. That would include me….

![It gets steep and exposed here.](images/Chora_steep_trail_IMG_3955.MOV)

![Look down and see why I was scared!](images/Chora_scary_IMG_3956.MOV)

But that was the end of it--when we were through the scary bit, we were also done with the actual trail. All that was left was a long walk down the paved road into Chora Sfakion. 

We got into town around 1:00, ideal time to find a seaside taverna at which to while away a long blue Saturday afternoon. We had been given directions to a cantina where we might hope to collect our suitcases. "Cantina" is the word for a really, really tiny snack bar. We didn't really need the directions, since as we walked along the main road toward the ferry-dock, we saw our bags sitting on the side of the road. Chris paid the young lady at the nearby cantina €5 or something like that, as we had been instructed. It is not clear that she knew that our bags had been delivered to her care, or why she was getting €5. All set, we picked a likely taverna for a long lunch.

![What people do in Chora Sfakion.](images/Chora_taverna_IMG_3978.jpg)

We finally sampled the famous Sfakia ni pita, which Kyriakis had recommended to us back in Chania. It is… a cheese quesadilla. With honey. 

![Worth walking all the way to Chora Sfakion?](images/Chora_pita_IMG_3975.jpg)

It was vitally important that we not miss our ferry. We were supposed to start hiking from Sougia the next morning, where we would meet our guide Yannis. (Trekking Hellas gave us a guide for our last two days gratis. We are eternally grateful to them for hooking us up with Yannis!) If we missed the boat in Chora Sfakion, we would have to find some other way of traveling 90 minutes west, which might be impossible but more likely would just be expensive (probably a car could be arranged; maybe a boat). 

To avoid messing this up, we were at the ferry port a good 20 minutes early. The big ferry port. What we didn't know was that the boat we were taking wasn't the big ferry we'd seen earlier, but a more petite vessel. And it didn't dock at the big ferry port. It sailed right past us into the smaller harbor down the hill. 

But! We hadn't been walking for the past seven weeks straight for nothing! We sprinted down the road leading to the smaller dock and jumped on our actual ferry with minutes to spare. We even got seats up top.

![The top deck of the little ferry from Chora Sfakion to Agia Roumeli.](images/Chora_ferry_IMG_3979.jpg)

This particular boat stopped in Loutro and Marmara and then ended in Agia Roumeli. We had to change to a much bigger car ferry there.

We dearly love revisiting routes after the fact, and this ferry ride was particularly effective for showcasing the terrain we'd traversed.

![Did we really walk this? Where is the trail?](images/Loutro_trail_didwewalkthis_DJI_20241019164452_0059_D.MP4)

![Coming into Agia Roumeli, we could see the opening of the Samaria Gorge.](images/Agia_return_IMG_4001.MOV)

In Agia Roumeli, we were herded off our little ferry and herded on to the much bigger one parked at the dock for our continuing journey to Sougia. We used the voyage to scout out the trail Trekking Hellas says no one hikes because it's too dangerous. A guide on our boat was describing the route to another customer and concurred that it wasn't suitable. "You go up!" was her main description. Later, our guide Yannis described his own experience hiking that section, which was sufficiently terrifying (even for a strong professional mountain guide) that he never repeated it. 

![This is the start of the trail west from Agia Roumeli. Not to my taste at all!](images/Agia_trail_westward_IMG_4007.MOV)

![It's not clear where anyone would walk here.](images/Agia_where_walk_IMG_4020.jpg)

We disembarked in Sougia around sunset. There we spent a quiet evening, our last one on our own. Tomorrow we would meet up with Yannis, our guide for the next two days.
