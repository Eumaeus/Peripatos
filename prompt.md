I need assistance continuing a project to generate a static HTML-CSS website for my travel blog, hosted on GitHub Pages at `https://eumaeus.github.io` (GitHub account: `https://github.com/eumaeus`). The website is built from a collection of long-form travel blog posts, each written as a Markdown essay with an accompanying `images` directory containing images and videos. The posts were originally published on Substack (`https://eumaeus.substack.com`). Below is the current state of the project, including requirements, directory structure, and the provided solution. Please pick up where we left off, ensuring compatibility with the existing setup, and address any new requirements I provide.

**Project Context:**
- **Environment**: Iâ€™m using macOS, am comfortable with the Unix terminal, and have Homebrew installed. I have `pandoc` installed for Markdown-to-HTML conversion and use Python 3 with a virtual environment (`venv`) to manage dependencies (`markdown` and `beautifulsoup4`).
- **Goal**: Convert a directory of Markdown posts into a static website for GitHub Pages, with each post split into HTML files based on level-2 (`##`) headings, navigation links between sections, and a sidebar TOC linking to all content.
- **Current Solution**: A Python script (`generate_site.py`) processes the posts, generates HTML files, copies images, and creates a `docs` directory for GitHub Pages. The script uses `pandoc` for Markdown conversion and the `markdown` and `beautifulsoup4` Python libraries for parsing.

**Directory Structure:**
The posts are organized in a `posts` directory with a hierarchical structure for categorization and ordering:

posts/
  00 General/
    01 Welcome/
      post.md
      images/
        image1.jpg
    02 About/
      post.md
      images/
        image2.jpg
  01 Greece 2023/
    01 Athens/
      post.md
      images/
        image3.jpg
    02 Crete/
      post.md
      images/
        image4.jpg
  02 Greece 2024/
    01 Santorini/
      post.md
      images/
        image5.jpg
  03 Nepal/
    01 Kathmandu/
      post.md
      images/
        image6.jpg

- Top-level directories (e.g., `00 General`) define categories, sorted by their two-digit prefix.
- Subdirectories (e.g., `01 Welcome`) contain a `post.md` file and an `images` folder, sorted by their two-digit prefix.
- Each `post.md` has an `h1` heading for the post title and `h2` headings for sections.

**Output Structure:**
The script generates a `docs` directory:	

docs/
  index.html
  assets/
    css/
      style.css
    images/
      00-general/
        01-welcome/
          image1.jpg
      01-greece-2023/
        01-athens/
          image3.jpg
  00-general/
    01-welcome/
      section-1.html
      section-2.html
    02-about/
      section-1.html
  01-greece-2023/
    01-athens/
      section-1.html
    02-crete/
      section-1.html

- HTML files are split by `h2` headings (e.g., `section-1.html`).
- Images are copied to `assets/images/[category-slug]/[post-slug]/`.
- URLs follow the pattern `/[category-slug]/[post-slug]/section-x.html`.

**Current Script Features:**
The latest `generate_site.py` script (provided below) does the following:
- Reads the hierarchical `posts` directory.
- Generates a TOC grouped by category (e.g., `General`, `Greece 2023`), with posts listed under each category, ordered by directory prefixes.
- Creates a sidebar with a nested `<ul>` structure: categories (bold) and posts (indented links to `section-1.html`).
- Splits each `post.md` into HTML files based on `h2` headings, with previous/next navigation links.
- Copies images/videos to the output directory, preserving the folder structure.
- Generates an `index.html` with a welcome message.
- Uses basic CSS for a responsive layout (fixed sidebar, content area).
- Is idempotent, regenerating the site when new posts are added.

**Script (generate_site.py):**

**Requirements Already Met:**
- Hierarchical TOC based on category directories (e.g., `00 General`) and post subdirectories (e.g., `01 Welcome`).
- Sorting by two-digit prefixes for categories and posts.
- Clean category names in TOC (e.g., `00 General` displays as `General`).
- Nested URL structure (e.g., `/01-greece-2023/01-athens/section-1.html`).
- Support for `pandoc` Markdown conversion and image handling.
- Deployment to GitHub Pages (`docs` folder).
