        <h2 id="kavousi-1990">Kavousi 1990</h2>
<p><em>Raiders of the Lost Ark</em> has been one of my favorite movies
ever since Stephen Berry’s mom, Betty Berry, took him, me, and my
brother to see it in the theatre. Archaeology! How exciting!</p>
<p>When I got to Duke, I thought I would finally have the chance to
study archaeology. It would be just like Indiana Jones’s class at
Stanford, or whatever university he’s meant to be teaching at, though I
never could make out exactly what he was talking about in the lecture
scene. Anyway, Duke! It’s a university! Surely there would be
archaeology!</p>
<figure>
<img alt="Duke chapel, same as it ever was." src="/assets/images/01 Greece/20 Kavousi/Duke_Chapel_IMG_4560.jpg"/>
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Duke chapel, same as it ever
was.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Well, yes and no. What I didn’t know is that not every university has
all the things, and most class offerings are highly dependent on what
the given professors feel like teaching at any given moment. And it’s
not the easiest thing in the world to even figure out what department
would teach archaeology. Egyptian stuff? Not at Duke. (Maybe in
Religion?) Dinosaur bones? Likewise. (Geology?) Anthropology didn’t have
much in the Indiana Jones line, though they did have some solid physical
anthropology offerings on hominids, and I did enjoy my classes at the
lemur center.</p>
<p>But I have my modest store of student-craft, so I did what one does
in these situations: I asked my classics-major boyfriend what he
thought. (This was shortly before I met Chris….) He suggested that I
take John Younger’s Aegean Bronze Age class. So I did.</p>
<p>This class was great! It was all about Crete, plus Mycenae. And
Thira, before Santorini was a thing. Maybe some other Aegean islands, I
can’t remember.</p>
<p>We studied all the <a href="http://www.minoancrete.com/index.html">major sites in
Crete</a>–Knossos, Kato Zakros, Phaestos. For my project, I searched the
Linear B records for references to bull leaping. (My findings: the
Linear B records say nothing whatsoever about bull leaping because they
are just inventories of pots and such, though bovids are mentioned in a
few lists.) The next semester, Younger set me up with an independent
study reading through Sir Arthur Evans’ diaries from the excavations at
Knossos. I loved me some Crete!</p>
<p>So it was a no-brainer for me to ask him if he could get me onto a
dig the summer after I finished study abroad in Paris. No problem, he
said, and sent me to Kavousi.</p>

<h3 id="eastern-crete">Eastern Crete</h3>
<p>Getting to eastern Crete in June, 1990, wasn’t quick or easy. Here’s
what I did:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>I took a charter flight from Orly airport to Athens. Charter
flights aren’t scheduled until a day or two before departure. This one
ended up leaving in the afternoon, putting me in Athens at the same
moment that the overnight ferry departed to Heraklion from Piraeus. I
was supposed to turn up in Kavousi the next day, so this was a
problem.</p></li>
<li><p>I walked from the international terminal to the domestic terminal
and bought the cheapest ticket to Heraklion–$50, leaving at 5 a.m.
Athens airport looked like a bus station in those days. I checked in my
bags for the flight.</p></li>
<li><p>I took a city bus into town and got off at Syntagma. I spent the
evening wandering around the National Gardens and the lower slopes of
the Acropolis–only the top was enclosed in those days.</p></li>
<li><p>After it got dark, I took the bus back to the airport and spent
the rest of the night sitting there. I befriended a young German woman
who was on the same flight; she was going to meet her Cretan
boyfriend.</p></li>
<li><p>We boarded before dawn and landed in Heraklion as the sun came
up. Heraklion airport looked even more like a bus station than Athens
airport.</p></li>
<li><p>I took a city bus to the eastern Crete bus terminal.</p></li>
<li><p>I boarded another bus for the two-hour drive to <a href="https://www.crete-today.com/pachia-ammos/">Pacheia Ammos</a>,
where the dig personnel were assembling and where most of them were
staying. I had no idea the drive would take two hours, though, so I kept
setting my alarm in ten-minute increments so I wouldn’t sleep through my
stop.</p></li>
<li><p>In Pacheia Ammos, I learned that I’d be staying in Kavousi
itself. A few us us drove the 15 minutes further east to our summer
home, and I moved into my room around noon.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>That was a long trip.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">The road into Kavousi</figcaption>
</figure>
<h3 id="the-town">The town</h3>
<p>So, Kavousi. Today, Kavousi is a very small town located on the
Lasithi plateau about half an hour east of Agios Nikolaus. The permanent
population is about 600. That hasn’t changed much since 1990.</p>
<p>But Kavousi has been inhabited for millenia. Kavousi itself is
situated in a lovely area, with access to both mountains and the sea.
The main highway still runs through it, evidence that it’s at an ideal
crossroads location. The name “Kavousi” is a Cretan dialect word for
“water source,” suggesting that this might have been a reason to settle
here.</p>
<p>Someone planted an olive tree there a very long time ago.
Minoans?</p>
<figure>
<img alt="This olive tree is said to be 3,400 years old!" src="/assets/images/01 Greece/20 Kavousi/Kavousi_olive_tree_IMG_9665.jpg"/>
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">This olive tree is said to be 3,400 years
old!</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In 1990, the town was just beginning to modernize. There was
electricity, but no air conditioning. I shared a room that had two twin
beds with another girl. We had a bathroom, but you couldn’t put toilet
paper in the toilet. (It took my roommate a few days to believe this.)
There was no storage, so we kept our things under our beds.</p>

<h3 id="the-kastro">The Kastro</h3>
<figure>
<img alt="The site on the Kastro" src="/assets/images/01 Greece/20 Kavousi/Kastro_site_IMG_9618.jpg"/>
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">The site on the Kastro</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The <a href="https://instapstudycenter.net/archaeological-projects/ascsa-projects/kastro/">Kastro</a>
site, perched on a mountain peak, was founded around 1,200 BCE. It’s a
bit younger than the lower Vronda site, where most of the dig was
concentrated. The name “Kastro” means “castle,” though there’s nothing
about the Kastro that would remind anyone of an actual castle. It’s just
<a href="https://www.ascsa.edu.gr/uploads/media/hesperia/147919.pdf">a
few “houses” stuck on top of a mountain</a>, and they were not nice
houses.</p>
<p>The Kastro itself would have been a rough place to live. The views
are amazing, to be sure, but living up there would have been … hard.
There’s no obvious spring nearby. The east side is at the top of a
gorge. I can’t imagine having babies up there. They would just toddle
right off the edge.</p>
<p>But the Kastro was inhabited from 1,200 until the late 7th century
BCE. That’s a good five hundred years. The people who lived up there
must have had a good reason to put themselves to such inconvenience and
danger. Pirates, say historians. Better to live on a waterless
mountaintop than have your children snatched from their beds at
night….</p>

</figure>
<p>Dig days started early. My alarm went off at 5:25. I’d put in my
contacts, don my work clothes, and eat a tiny breakfast of two <a href="https://www.englishteastore.com/products/mcvities-dark-chocolate-digestives-300g">McVities
Digestive Biscuits</a> spread with either Nutella or a low-rent Greek
knockoff; it tasted the same, but always had half an inch of oil sitting
on top of the chocolate spread.</p>

</figure>
<p>Those of us staying in Kavousi itself had it easy–we strolled down to
the Pharangi taverna and boarded the pickup trucks at 5:50. The rest of
the team had to get up and out early enough to catch the bus to Kavousi
first. (Or maybe the trucks picked them up? I don’t remember. Maybe the
bus didn’t run that early.)</p>
<p>It was dark. That summer I discovered the procession of the stars
across the heavens. I’d never before noticed that the moon rises
noticeably later every day, or that the stars are in a slightly
different place every morning–the moon is easy to see, but the movement
of the stars is only apparent if you watch the sky from the same place
for several weeks.</p>
<p>We sat on two-by-fours in the backs of pickup trucks. That’s always
been one of my favorite modes of travel in hot, dry places like summer
camp in West Texas. In un-air-conditioned eastern Crete, it was the only
time we felt a breeze.</p>
<p>We drove up the dirt road next at the western end of Kavousi, winding
among the olive groves and bouncing on the rocks. It took about 20
minutes to reach the lower site, Vronda, where most of the crew
disembarked.</p>

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">This area is riddled with ancient

</figure>
<p>The Kavousi team kept on going to the little dirt cutout under a
sheer cliff face where it was possible to turn around and park two
trucks. There, we got out and started climbing.</p>
<p>To reach the Kastro, we hiked up an old “cobbled Turkish road” called
a <em>kalderimi</em>.</p>
<p>A cobbled road–what does that mean? It means a trail, but one that’s
been enhanced with rocks and that at least used to be maintained. It was
narrow, rocky, and twisty, and some bits were steep.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>Two older men met us at the trailhead, having walked up from Kavousi
with donkeys. These donkeys carried some water up, but they were mainly
there to transport our potsherds back down. The men murmured endearments
to their donkeys all the way up and down.</p>
<p>Up and up we went, everyone generally walking alone with their

<p>I recall it taking us about 30 minutes to climb from the parking area
to the Kastro; more recent experience suggests that it must have been
closer to 45 minutes. And not everyone was young!</p>
<p>That was a wonderful way to start every day. The Mediterranean was
always visible off to the north. Sunrise gradually got later and later
over the course of the summer, until we were doing almost the entire
walk in the pre-dawn dusk, and the sun appeared over the tops of the
peaks to the east as we rounded the bend to the gorge that lay to the
east of the Kastro.</p>

<p>Having arrived at our mountaintop worksite, everyone took a moment to
collect themselves. The veterans all had <a href="https://alaellinika.com/product/shaker-for-greek-frappe/?srsltid=AfmBOorCUqHAlR5HQ3pF54YccM58HbMRlvtSVO2m1TZMrUCPWsbG9miZFvE">frappé
shakers</a> so they could make themselves instant Nescafe. <a href="https://www.archaeological.org/endowment/william-d-e-coulson-memorial-lectureship/">Bill
Coulson</a> always started the day with a shot of raki, which he would
generously share with me. It’s not a habit I’ve maintained, but it did
wake me up.</p>
<p>Each grad student or professor was in charge of their own portion of
the dig, which amounted to each person excavating their own house.
Everyone had a trench assistant. I was one of those.</p>
<p>At the start of the dig, I hadn’t been assigned a trench, so <a href="https://classics.unc.edu/people-3/faculty-2-2/donald-c-haggis/">Donald
Haggis</a> took me on as an extra assistant; he was already working with
a young Greek woman. He was <a href="https://www.ascsa.edu.gr/uploads/media/hesperia/148436.pdf">excavating
a house</a> on the west side of the main peak. He was also doing a
bigger project, a field survey of this part of eastern Crete.</p>

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Donald Haggis and me in his
trench.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The work was kind of meditative. (Not to say boring….) We slowly and
painstakingly chipped the dirt off the rocks that had formed the base of
the walls of houses. We made great use of whisk brooms, sweeping the
dust off the dirt. The trick was to find a “floor,” which was difficult,
given that any floor would be made of the same dirt we’d just dug off
it.</p>
<p>As we dug, we’d turn up bits of long-broken pottery. These all went
into collecting buckets.</p>
<p>Donald taught me how to make measured drawings using a string and a
tape measure. I enjoyed making those. He also showed me how to use the
surveying telescope for taking elevations.</p>

</figure>
<p>The point of all this activity was to get a <a href="https://www.ascsa.edu.gr/uploads/media/hesperia/148394.pdf">good
overview of the settlement</a> and its history. (All results described
in the linked publications. I myself am no expert on this field!)</p>
<p>At 10:30, the dig leaders would call “Kolazo!” That was the signal
for our lunch (breakfast?) break. We’d sit down in the odd patches of
shade with our Laughing Cow cheese, crackers, boiled eggs, and whatever
other foodstuffs we’d managed to find that would survive the walk up the
hill. Canned tuna with peas mixed in was a popular discovery.</p>
<p>As the summer wore on, I befriended several of the local workers, and
my lunches got immeasurably better. A 12-year-old boy who’d landed a job
(at union rates!) always had a great pile of containers of food
furnished by his mother–bread, mizithra, kalamari. He would say to me:
“Amy! Eat! Kalamari!” And I did.</p>
<p>After lunch, we’d work for another couple of hours. Around 1:30, the
workers would load up the donkeys with the day’s finds, and we’d head
back down the kalderimi path to the trucks. This walk always went faster
than the walk uphill. We’d pile back into the trucks, stop at Vronda to
pick up the rest of the dig staff, and drive down to the Apothiki.</p>
<p>It never once rained. Not once, all summer. My nose was always full
of dust.</p>

</figure>
<p>The whitewashed apothiki at the top of town was the dig’s workshop.
This was where we sorted our pottery, redid drawings using the light
table, and … I don’t know what else. Mainly we sorted pottery.</p>
<p>Kavousi’s residents apparently loved dig time because they made bank.
While most of the guys were up on the dig doing heavy manual labor, the
town’s women got jobs washing pottery. They’d spend part of the day
sitting at the apothiki, scrubbing dirt off potsherds with toothbrushes.
They were instructed to work gently, so as not to scrub off paint or
clay as well, but this did not always happen. It was even rumored that
when the bristles wore completely off the brushes, they’d simply turn
them over and scrub with the back sides.</p>
<p>Every trench had its own table made of trestles and plywood set out
under the trees. When the ladies were done washing the potsherds, they’d
spread them on the respective tables to dry in the sun. The previous
day’s pottery was always still slightly damp when we arrived.</p>
<p>First thing, everyone would put in a drink order, and someone would
bring up heaps of cold cans from the Pharangi taverna. I started the
summer drinking Coke, but soon switched to Limonata and club soda. We
were so thirsty, and the club soda had a bit of salt in it that seemed
to help with my nighttime leg cramps.</p>
<p>We could never drink enough.</p>
<p>The apothiki also had the only toilet we encountered during the
workday. (Most days on the Kastro, I just never went. It was so dry. If
anyone did need to go, they had to pick their way around the high side
of the gorge and find a convenient rock or bush.) It had a bucket flush
system–you filled a bucket from a hose and dumped it into the toilet to
flush.</p>
<p>We spent the afternoon sorting our broken bits of pottery into
categories–edges, handles, bases, spouts, body pieces. Anything with
paint got special attention. We’d try to fit pieces together, but that
was mostly a fool’s errand after 3000 years. It was easiest with
potsherd’s we’d accidently broken ourselves.</p>
<p>I’m told that the junky pottery got dumped into a well at the end of
the season.</p>

</figure>
<p>At 5, we were done. We walked down the steep, grooved pavement though
the town and crossed the street to our rooms. We showered. I’d wash my
dig clothes at the same time. Showers were supposed to be short to
conserve water, and some of us observed that we always finished our
showers with a lingering coat of dirt on our skins that came off on the
towels. We hung our clothes to dry on the clothesline on the balcony,
and then walked down to the Pharangi.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Imagine this patio full of

</figure>
<p>I never knew why we always went there. There was a perfectly good
taverna under our rooms, and we did eat there once or twice, but the
Pharangi was the social nexus of the dig.</p>
<p>Manolis Douloumi was in his early 20s at the time, and he was the
master of the establishment during his summer breaks from the University
of Thessaloniki. He was always so friendly and happy to see us.</p>
<figure>
<img alt="Manolis only came up the mountain once that summer, for the end-of-dig party. Usually, he had to work in the taverna. That’s him on the right, in the blue plaid shirt." src="/assets/images/01 Greece/20 Kavousi/Amy_Manolis_party_Kastro_img120.jpg"/>

that summer, for the end-of-dig party. Usually, he had to work in the

</figure>
<p>The food there was simple, but it tasted so good. The chicken tasted
like the herbs everywhere on the hillsides. Manolis says the french
fries were so delicious because he fried them all in his family’s olive
oil. My favorite meal was kalamari and horiatiki.</p>
<p>We helped ourselves to soft drinks from the fridge. Wine came in
little pitchers filled from a barrel of the Douloumi family’s wine.</p>
<p>And oh, it was cheap! The whole summer cost maybe a thousand dollars,
including room and occasional bus rides.</p>
<p>The Pharangi was where we received and made phone calls. I gave my
parents the number and told them the times I was likely to be around,
and they would call me once a week or so. It was MUCH easier to have
them call me than to call out, which involved multiple numbers and a
calling card, and mostly just didn’t work anyway.</p>
<h3 id="entertainment">Entertainment</h3>
<p>There was not much to do in Kavousi. The TV at the Pharangi played
Greek television, mostly the World Cup or politics. No one had computers
or cell phones in those days!</p>
<p>Kids today might find this hard to believe, but we managed to
entertain ourselves. We read a lot. Favorite novels were passed around
based on an informal waiting list. The copy of a Clive Cussler novel
involving a sexy lady archaeologist was especially popular. (I just did
a little searching, and I have identified this book as
<em>Treasure,</em> published in 1988. It begins with the sexy lady
archaeologist working in Greenland, where her parka conceals the size of
her assets. She and Dirk Pitt then proceed to travel effectively
everywhere in search of the lost Library of Alexandria.)</p>
<p>I read my first Robertson Davies novel, <em>The Rebel Angels</em>,
which rocked my world and had a lot to do with the path that I followed
immediately thereafter. I wanted to be the character Maria–so
sophisticated and cosmopolitan and exotic and multilingual, and all her
professors were in love with her! That book performed the minor miracle
of making humanities grad school sound sexy. I read the notorious pink
ribbon scene on the Sunday that a worldly grad student took me to the
famous (notorious?) Vai Beach, land of nude Germans.</p>
<p>Some nights we played poker for drachmas. That was fun. Someone must
have had a tape deck; Eric Clapton’s <em>Timepieces</em> and Van
Morrison’s <em>Moondance</em> were sounds of the summer and the cds I
bought the instant I got back home.</p>
<p>Every Tuesday and Friday afternoon, we were excused from apothiki
duty. This gave us time to catch the bus into Agio Nikolaus or Ierapetra
to visit a proper grocery store or ATM and grab a restaurant meal. Ag
Nik had a Chinese restaurant that was especially popular.</p>
<p>Some Saturday mornings we worked at the apothiki. Those weekends, it
was impossible to go anywhere substantial; it took two full hours to get
to Heraklion on the bus, and we had to be back in Kavousi by Sunday
evening. But we could still spend Sunday at the beach in <a href="https://www.discovergreece.com/crete/ierapetra">Ierapetra</a> or
<a href="https://www.cretetravel.com/en/guide/17/Agios_Nikolaos">Agios
Nikolaus</a>.</p>
<p>Ierapetra was especially beautiful, with its view south over the
Libyan Sea and its wooden platforms out in the water, though you had to
avoid stepping on the sea urchins. It was a lovely place to while away
an afternoon drinking frappés under a taverna shade.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Ierapetra is on the south coast,

</figure>
<p>My first time in Ierapetra, I bought a pair of leather flip flops
that were some of the best shoes I’ve ever had. I wore them all summer
and kept them in my closet in Baton Rouge as pool shoes for years
after.</p>
<p>Every other Saturday we had off. If we left Friday afternoon, we
could actually go places. One weekend, I went off with the assistant
paleobotanist and two other trench assistants for a trip all the way to
Chania, at the western end of Crete. (The actual paleobotanist never
showed up that summer, so the assistant was in charge of water seiving
all the dirt specimens for ancient seeds or whatever.) The assistant
paleobotanist gave me his walkman so I could listen to this great new
band called They Might Be Giants as the bus drove west into the
mountains near Ag Nik. We had to stay in Heraklion on Friday night
because the bus got there too late for us to continue on. I ran into my
Duke prof John Younger, who was drinking ouzo in the town square. Small
world.</p>

<p>I tried going to the beach on the north coast a few times, but it was
invariably disappointing. The beach at Sitia was about 2 meters wide,
which seemed pointless, and the water in Agios Nikolaus was full of
potato chip bags.</p>

<p>One weekend, I went to Heraklion by myself to visit <a href="https://knossos-palace.gr/?tm=tt&amp;ap=gads&amp;aaid=adammXapZvTAX&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gbraid=0AAAAApg46RV-oVGUi_j7z0Uwm71Vj89Om&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjw-qi_BhBxEiwAkxvbkHvH13GLdZ3WSTYnozyhClCYO8dA5hOYys1vEYKvCzZmpY0xnaVk_RoC1uAQAvD_BwE">Knossos</a>.
I’m glad I did, because it was possible to actually see the place in
those days, without today’s hordes of tourists. I doubt I’ll ever go
there now.</p>

<p>I left Kavousi in early August and made my slow and deliberate way
back to Baton Rouge. The slowness was the result of silly decisions.
Back in Paris, I’d bought a round-trip ticket between Paris and Athens
from a charter company. These tickets were for specific dates, but you
couldn’t find out what time they left until three days ahead of time. I
was returning to Paris because I had a round-trip, open-ended student
ticket between the US and Paris–one of those tickets that you couldn’t
schedule more than 72-hours in advance, based on space available.</p>
<p>It was years later that it occurred to me that we could’ve saved a
lot of trouble and money if I’d just bought a one-way ticket to Greece
and then just flown straight home from there.</p>
<p>As things turned out, Duke called my parents and said I’d been made
an RA. I had to turn up for training on a specific date in August. This
meant scheduling a flight like a responsible adult with a job. So I had
my dad buy me a ticket home from Paris the day after I was supposed to
return from Greece.</p>
<p>To learn what time my flight to Paris would depart, I had to call the
French charter company. This proved impossible to do with the Pharangi’s
telephone. I basically had to go to Athens to make a phone call.</p>
<p>This time I took the overnight ferry, deck class as we students did.
Never again! No matter how hot the summer, spending a night in the wind
on the deck of a sailing ship is freezing. Also, a bench is not
comfortable to sleep on.</p>
<p>In Athens, I spent three nights in a nice hotel near Kolonaki Square
and the American School. That remains one of my favorite parts of
Athens. I visited the Acropolis, the archaeology museum, and the
Kolonaki Museum, where I bought a great pair of earrings and a book of
embroidery patterns. I took two baths a day.</p>

<p>I made it back to Paris and thence Baton Rouge, of course. Three days
later, I drove up to Durham. The next week, I attended a photo lecture
by John Younger, who was sharing the story of his own summer in
Crete.</p>
<p>There, I met a new classics grad student named Chris Blackwell. He
invited me to see <em>Fantasia</em> with him. He wore an Atlanta Braves
baseball cap held together with duct tape, he drove a pickup truck, and
he’d read Robertson Davies, too.</p>
