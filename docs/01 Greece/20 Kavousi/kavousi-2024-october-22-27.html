<p>The last week of Chris’ sabbatical trip was the perfect opportunity
to return to Kavousi, where we could catch up on work and explore
eastern Crete. This was the first time we could live in Kavousi as
modern adults–with a car, and a kitchen, and jobs.</p>
<h3 id="tuesday-october-22">Tuesday, October 22</h3>
<p>We started the day in Chania, enjoying our nice hotel and its strong
hot shower. After breakfast on the balcony overlooking the old town, we
picked up our rented VW Polo (€259 for a week–not bad).</p>
<figure>
<img alt="Our fun blue Polo parked by our house in Kavousi!" src="/assets/images/01 Greece/20 Kavousi/Polo_IMG_4222.jpg"/>
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Our fun blue Polo parked by our house in
Kavousi!</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We drove out of Chania onto to the Ethniki Odo, heading east toward
Heraklion and thence Kavousi. We passed countless beach resorts built on
the south side of the highway; tourist wanting to visit the beach have
to race across this busy road, surely an enticing proposition for
families with kids or old people.</p>
<p>The driver who took us from Rethymno to Chania two weeks earlier had
told us that this stretch of road is the most dangerous in Greece (or
maybe Europe?). Thank the hordes of tourists in rental cars mixed with
the drunk and the impatient. On a weekday morning, though, it wasn’t so
bad.</p>
<p>The coast east of Heraklion is now entirely built up with vacation
resorts and villas. But the road up to Agios Nikolaus is four-laned and
new, and new sections were being built through the mountains as we drove
through.</p>
<p>East of Agios Nikolaus, the road narrows down to the old two-lane
highway. We rounded Mirabello Bay, passed Pacheia Ammos and the turn-off
for Ierapetra, and then we were in Kavousi.</p>
<p>Our AirBnB hosts had given us detailed albeit baffling directions for
how to reach the house. This involved driving up the road toward the
Kastro and then veering off to the right, steeply up and down a gully,
rounding a church, and then arriving at the parking lot next to the old
apothiki. Their directions actually said, “You will think you are on the
wrong path, but keep going!”</p>

<img alt="You turn here." src="/assets/images/01 Greece/20 Kavousi/Road_to_sites_IMG_9494.jpg"/>

<p>The road also comes to the house from the other direction, but I’m
not sure that way isn’t actually too steep for a car.</p>

<p>This house was the apotheosis of all our Greek rentals. A labor of
love, it is huge and beautiful and filled with archaeological treatises
in English, French, German, and Greek. The owner knows the people at
INSTAP, the center for study of eastern Crete, and often rents the house
to my old friend Donald Haggis when he comes to stay in the summers. She
picks and chooses her tenants, and doesn’t rent the house often. We were
lucky that it was free and that she let us stay there!</p>

<p>We walked down to check out the “big” grocery store, which is not
exactly big but is larger than many Greek “supermarkets.” They at least
had the makings of a horiatiki and sparkling waters. We had a car, so we
could shop in bigger towns.</p>

<p>That evening, we strolled down the hill back to Chez Georges for an
aperitif and then had dinner at Ntakos. The proprietor there remembered
us from last year. He brought out the old reception book from the early
90s. Some of my dig people were in there from 1990, but I’d never signed
in personally so there was no trace of my presence.</p>
<h3 id="wednesday-october-23-tholos-beach-and-agios-nikolaus">Wednesday,
October 23: Tholos Beach and Agios Nikolaus</h3>

<img alt="Our view at breakfast" src="/assets/images/01 Greece/20 Kavousi/Kavous_dawn_IMG_4453.jpg"/>
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Our view at breakfast</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We had breakfast on our beautiful balcony overlooking Kavousi and
Mirabello Bay. Georges had given us a large jar of local honey for free.
It was so good on yogurt!</p>
<p>Last year, Chris had suggested that we do a “mountain to the sea”
hike to simulate life on a Minoan mountaintop settlement. You can see
the ocean from the Kastro, and surely people would’ve made occasional
trips down there to fish and have beach parties. Fear of pirates or not,
they were Greeks! (Hm. Actually, they weren’t. But they were
Mediterranean, so surely they loved to have barbecues and relax by the
ocean.)</p>
<p>The hardcore way to do this would be to start at the Kastro, walk all
the way down to Tholos beach, eat some fish there and maybe cavort about
like Nausicaa and her girlfriends doing laundry, and then return to the
Kastro. Ideally all on the same day. Even more ideally, having slept on
the Kastro the night before.</p>
<p>That would obviously never work. No money would persuade me to spend
a night in a tent on the Kastro just so we could start our journey
there. Also, any hike that passed through town in both directions would
surely end at that point because we would just go home.</p>
<p>But life is full of compromises! We agreed that we could do this
research journey on two separate days, both of which would start and end
in the comfort of our house in Kavousi. Today we took the low road and
walked to the beach.</p>

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">The road to Tholos passes through acres

</figure>
<p>Though the road to Tholos is basically flat and has almost no
traffic, and it’s really not that far, it was surprisingly tiring. It
takes a solid 45 minutes to reach the water. In 1990, some of us had
walked down there once or twice to go to the beach, but it was too far
to be a relaxing outing. We found that it didn’t feel any closer
now.</p>

<p>In need of real groceries, we spent the afternoon in the big city of
Agios Nikolaus.</p>
<p>Now, I’d been to Ag Nik a number of times in 1990, always on the bus.
All of us knew where to find the ATM, the good grocery store, the
Chinese restaurant.</p>
<p>I have never felt so unfamiliar with a place that I once knew well. I
recognized nothing. The place is now packed with tourists, seemingly all
from Germany. Even in late October. It’s nothing but souvenir shops and
streets lined with the same restaurants with the same touts outside.</p>
<p>We got ice creams at a shop by the famous inland lake, which I also
didn’t remember. Could it be that the beach where I tried to swim was on
the lake? Who knows. For my ice cream, I got <a href="https://www.kalofagas.ca/2022/10/26/kaimaki-ice-cream/">kaimaki</a>,
which is made with mastiha from Kos and salep–a very Turkish taste and
texture.</p>
<p>That evening, we were joined by an orange and white cat who appeared
on our balcony and made herself at home.</p>

<p>This was the first time I’d ever gotten a good aerial view of the
Kastro. Drones must be a game-changer for archaeologists. In the 1980s,
the only way to get aerial shots was to hire a hot-air balloon, of all
things.</p>
<p>That evening, we met Manolis for dinner in Ierapetra. We left early
to take care of a special errand.</p>
<p>Our son was getting married in December. Before we left on our trip,
my mother had suggested that I buy his fiancée, Biruja, a wedding veil
in Greece. That sounded like a great idea! Greece and wedding veils just
seem to go together–in my imagination, at least. As it happened, though,
we’d traveled the length and breadth of the country and seen nary a
wedding veil. Maybe if we’d been a big city, but wedding stores just
didn’t seem to be a thing anywhere we went.</p>
<p>This was our last week, so it was now or never. Some web searching
revealed a couple of possibilities in eastern Crete–one in Heraklion,
and one in Ierapetra!</p>
<p>After some minor wandering, we found the shop: <a href="https://www.antzelaboutique.gr/en/">Antzela</a>. It’s not a
dedicated bridal shop, more a fancy ladies’ clothing boutique.</p>
<p>The ladies running the place were somewhat taken aback by my request
for a wedding veil, and even more when I said I wanted it then and
there. But! The Greeks are a resourceful people. The owner remembered
that they had a wedding veil sitting in a cabinet in the back. Her
daughter excavated it and modeled it for us.</p>

<p>It was exactly what I wanted–just ankle length, simple but very Greek
looking.</p>
<p>Veil literally in the bag, we met Manolis for dinner at Cleio’s, run
by his friend Cleio. It was great to see him again. When I told him
about the eroded state of the trail up to the Kastro, he lamented that
the kalderini hasn’t been maintained. Cutting dirt roads through it
causes it to break down.</p>
<p>Cleio gave us the customary free sweet after our meal. Her husband
had made <a href="https://www.thegreekvibe.com/ypovrichio-the-greek-submarine-spoon-sweet/">Ypovrichio</a>,
or submarines–spoons of a sweet paste flavored with mastic submerged in
a glass of water. It’s kind of like a chewy lollipop.</p>
<p>This is the second time in two days that I’ve mentioned mastic.
Mastic, or <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Chios-Mastiha-Natural-Mastic-Growers/dp/B07Q454QLH?source=ps-sl-shoppingads-lpcontext&amp;ref_=fplfs&amp;psc=1&amp;smid=A1FRTHPJ20XABI&amp;gQT=1">mastiha</a>,
is a solid plant resin from the mastic tree, <em>Pistacia
lentiscus</em>. It comes from the island of <a href="https://www.visitgreece.gr/islands/north-aegean-islands/chios/">Chios</a>,
which has made a living out of the stuff for thousands of years and
still does today; everyone in Greece knows that <a href="https://www.slofoodgroup.com/products/chios-mastiha-mastic-gum?srsltid=AfmBOoqrKSKCap-0COV8JDHRfyWFeJX7fTT9_IkTgWu_-iy1yvjinD63">mastiha</a>
comes from Chios. It tastes kind of piney.</p>
<p>I like Ierapetra better than Agios Nikolaus. It seems more natural,
less set up for tourism. Also, it’s quicker to drive there from
Kavousi.</p>

<p>The previous year, we were riding in a car climbing up the mountains
high above the Gulf of Corinth when we happened to tell our driver,
Demetrios, that we’d come from Crete. Crete! Oh, he had a video we must
see!</p>
<p>Demetrios immediately diverted his attention from negotiating a
winding mountain road next to a 500-foot drop-off into the ocean to
searching through his phone for this video. It turned out that when he’s
not driving a car, he is a professional drummer. He’d participated in a
traditional music performance in the Cave of Zeus (pronounced “Zefs”).
Evidently Zeus was born on Crete and raised in this cave. We must see it
when we returned to Crete!</p>
<p>Well, we were back in Crete, so maybe it was time to see this famous
cave!</p>
<p>Why I thought it wouldn’t be a massive tourist trap, I don’t
know.</p>
<p>Anyway! We headed out toward Agios Nikolaus but then cut off into the
mountains to the west. Up and up we wound. We stopped for coffee at a
roadside stand/tourist souvenir shop, where the proprietor showed us a
video of his resin woodworking technique and succeeded in persuading us
that we needed to own some of his productions.</p>
<p>After some more driving in the remotest of mountains, we emerged onto
the Lasithi plateau, famed for its old wood and cloth windmills. Does
any serious farmer still use these things? Surely not. In late October,
lots of the cloth had fallen to bits and was just handing in shreds on
the wooden frames. I imagine they redo them at the start of tourist
season in the spring.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.visitgreece.gr/experiences/nature/caves/diktaean-cave/">Diktaean
Cave</a> is located in the town of Psychro. The entrance is above a
parking lot full of the usual tourist schlock. In the summer, the place
must be mobbed with buses–you can book a tour of the whole Lasithi
Plateau, which will take you to see the windmills too.</p>
<p>On a gray weekday in late October, parking wasn’t a big deal. Though
it is possible that the parking lot was empty partly due to the fact
that the cave was closed that day.</p>
<figure>
<img alt="Sorry, folks, park’s closed!" src="/assets/images/01 Greece/20 Kavousi/Cave_of_Zeus_IMG_4384.jpg"/>
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Sorry, folks, park’s closed!</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I should know by now always to check these things before setting
out.</p>
<p>For what it’s worth, the Diktaean cave looks like it might be an
interesting cave to visit, at least in the spelunking sense. Even though
I’m not convinced that Zeus ever lived there. Like most sites in Crete,
it’s best enjoyed by the nimble and sure-footed.</p>
<p>On the way home, we stopped at the Sklavenitis in Agios Nikolaus to
buy Friskies for our balcony cat.</p>

Sitia and Kato Zakros</h3>
<p>For our last Saturday in Greece, I wanted to show Chris a better time
than I had the day before, with our fail-venture to the cave of Zefs.
This time, we headed east.</p>
<p>The highway east of Kavousi looks much like it did in 1990. It’s two
lanes all the way, winding around the sides of mountains. If you end up
behind a truck, you go that truck’s speed until it leaves the road.</p>
<p>We stopped for coffee in the eastern town of Sitia. Sitia used to be
famous for a pelican that hung around the harbor, but it’s not there
anymore.</p>

<p>The far eastern end of Crete isn’t very developed or much visited. It
takes some serious driving to get out here, which would discourage
package tourists and even self-caterers.</p>
<p>Our objective was <a href="https://www.cretetravel.com/en/guide/19/Kato_Zakros">Kato
Zakros</a>, where we could visit the Minoan site of <a href="http://www.minoancrete.com/zakros.htm">Zakros</a> and the
so-called <a href="https://www.greeka.com/crete/lassithi/sightseeing/lassithi-gorge-of-the-dead/">Gorge
of the Dead</a>.</p>
<p>This <a href="https://zakrospoliteia.gr/en/blog/articles/faraghghi-ton-nekrwn-zakros">gorge</a>
is an interesting site. The E4 trail goes through it, from the hill
village of Zakros all the way to the tiny town of Kato Zakros on the
coast.</p>

<p>The south coast is getting more and more built up with tourist
amenities, though many places still seem rough.</p>
<p>We stopped at the Sklavenitis in Ierapetra on the road back to
Pacheia Ammos. This is where we should shop from now on; it’s closer
than Ag Nik and much easier to get in and out of.</p>

<p>This was our last lazy Sunday in Greece. The time had changed
overnight; daylight savings time had ended. (It would end again in the
U.S. the following Sunday, which meant we were jet lagged for
weeks.)</p>
<p>Over an entire summer of eating at the Pharangi taverna every day, I
never once asked why the place was named “the canyon.” This being our
last opportunity to rectify my youthful ignorance, we walked out to see
the famous gorge.</p>

October.</p>

<p>We left the next day. It was just as well; another cat had started
moving in, and we needed to nip that in the bud.</p>
<p>We’d planned to visit Knossos on the way to the airport, but it was
mobbed with tourists. Like I said, I’m glad I saw it in 1990, because I
doubt I ever will again.</p>
