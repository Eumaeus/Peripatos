on the Ground: Practicalities.</h2>
<p>Not gonna lie, getting to, into, and through the Khumbu valley is mui
complicado. Here are some of the key things we had to think about on
this trip.</p>
<h3 id="getting-into-nepal">Getting into Nepal</h3>
<p>Nepal requires all visitors to purchase a visa upon arrival. They
sell them in 15-day and 30-day versions. Though our family members who
came for the wedding after our trek managed with 15-day visas, Chris and
I had to get the 30-day ones because we were in Nepal nearly a
month.</p>
<p>You buy the visas at the airport, which adds a line to stand in the
very moment you arrive in Nepal after an extremely long journey. It’s
best to arrive with exact cash in American dollars.</p>
<p>There are computer terminals where people can fill out visa forms
before joining the lines. I hear that they don’t always work, but our
kids had no trouble. It’s also possible to fill out the visa form online
ahead of time.</p>
<figure>

Kathmandu was the telephone poles. They all look like this.</a></video>
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">The first thing that struck us about
Kathmandu was the telephone poles. They all look like this.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We sent our visa applications and photos to Wilderness Travel as part
of the arrival service they offer. That meant that when we arrived, our
local contact Pankaj had our visa forms in hand. All we had to do was
hand him our fees. He went straight to the counter and got our visas in
under a minute. To my mind, that was money well spent–you hear of
tourists standing in line for two hours or more on particularly bad
days.</p>
<h3 id="gear">Gear</h3>
<p>Here’s what we carried:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>daypack (Osprey Tempest 20 for Amy,</li>
<li>Nalgene (fake, bought in Thamel) bottles</li>
<li>water blivets (2 liters; Chris had a 3-liter one)</li>
<li>sunglasses</li>
<li>Chris always carries random extra stuff: batteries, headlamps,
knives, emergency blanket, Leatherman, para-chord, duct-tape, sporks,
&amp;c. None of this was necessary, but he’s not going into the wild
(even the civilized “wild” like the Khumbu, without enough stuff to
survive a night outdoors).</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="clothes-and-shoes">Clothes and Shoes</h3>
<p>First, shoes, which are the most important! Both of us wore Altra
Lone Peaks throughout the trek. Trail runners!</p>
<figure>
<video controls="" src="/assets/images/03 Nepal/00 Introduction &amp; Training/ip16-IMG_5752.MOV"><a href="images/ip16-IMG_5752.MOV">Here you can see Amys’ load-out. She’s

the duffles. Bless him!</a></video>

</figure>
<p>How did this go, you ask? Didn’t we miss the ankle support and
protection of hiking boots?</p>
<p>No, we did not miss any aspect of hiking boots. We don’t miss the
stiff soles and the tight toes and the need to break the things in, and
we certainly don’t miss the weight.</p>
<p>We’ve worn Altras exclusively on all our multi-day treks in the Alps,
Greece, the Blue Ridge…. Since 2016, neither of us has worn anything
else.</p>
<p>Altra’s shoes are shaped like feet. They let our toes spread, which
is vital for balance and for general comfort. They’re zero drop, so they
don’t tip our bodies off balance with elevated heels. They are shoes,
not boots, which allow our ankles to rotate freely. (This is a good
thing–ankle joints are there to allow little adjustments. Neither of us
has ever sprained an ankle.) They’re lightweight, which makes it easy to
move quickly and to drag our feet up steps and steep slopes.</p>
<p>Amy used to wear Altra Superiors, which have the lightest cushioning
of all Altras, but those don’t work anymore. (Altra has a habit of
tweaking their perfect designs and rendering them useless.) Chris has
always loved Lone Peaks. Lone Peaks do seem to be the sweet spot of
enough cushion to avoid pain from walking on rocks without losing
groundfeel and hence proprioception.</p>
<p>Altra does sell some waterproof designs, but we don’t generally use
those. Do our feet get wet? Sometimes. It’s not a big deal.</p>
<p>Amy</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Hoodies in cooling fabrics (Patagonia capilene cool, Salt Life)</li>
<li>Baseball cap</li>
<li>Sunglasses</li>
<li>2 light leggings (1 lululemon, 1 Crz Yoga)</li>
<li>2 fleece leggings (Crz Yoga makes reasonably priced ones)</li>
<li>1 pair loose pants</li>
<li>1 pair shorts (to wear over leggings)</li>
<li>Mountain Hardwear Ghost Whisperer (superlightweight down jacket;
also super packable.)</li>
<li>Marmot Polartec Alpha jacket from several years ago (active
insulation)</li>
<li>Arcteryx Delta Light jacket (best lightweight fleece, also from
several years ago)</li>
<li>Lululemon define jacket</li>
<li>Mountain Hardwear stretch ozonic raincoat</li>
<li>2 Uniqlo heattech shirts (lightweight longsleeves for
insulation)</li>
<li>2 Uniqlo airism bra camis (as bra/undershirts for every day)</li>
<li>Coolmax toe socks (4 pairs?)</li>
<li>1 pair thin Uniqlo heattech socks to wear on top of toe socks on Ama
Dablam</li>

<h3 id="staying-clean">Staying clean</h3>
<p>Though we didn’t expect to have a modern, urban level of hygiene, no
one wants to stink or wear dirty clothes. Many guesthouses in the region
have single showers in the hall, shared by all guests, and perhaps
charge for their use. We chose our itinerary partly for the promise of
en suite bathrooms nearly everywhere.</p>
<p>The showers in most places were serviceable. Temperatures ranged from
genuinely hot (the gas-powered shower at Everest Summit Lodge in
Pangboche, at least when the knobs were set right) to genuinely cold
(Mountain Lodges of Nepal Namche on a day when the electricity had been
out since the previous night and the day had been mostly cloudy.)</p>
<figure>

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Our spacious and comfortable room (even
with no electricity) in Namche Bazaar.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>There were a couple of days we simply chose not to shower. Baby wipes
are a reasonable alternative. My attempts to use dry shampoo weren’t
terribly satisfying, though some people like the stuff.</p>
<p>One night we were promised two buckets of warm water in our room.
Those failed to materialize, which was just as well because the room was
so cold I doubt we’d have been able to make good use of them.</p>
<p>We’d worried about putting in contact lenses, but sinks and mirrors
were never a problem. This might be more difficult further up the trail
and certainly would be a consideration while camping, but that didn’t
come up for us.</p>
<p>We both regularly wash out clothes and hang them to dry while
traveling. That’s not entirely practical in the Khumbu, where room
temperatures can be in the 40s. It takes stuff forever to dry. The
technique of washing stuff at night and putting it back on still damp
the next morning (I’ve done this throughout the Alps) is less pleasant
when breakfast rooms are near freezing, though it can be done.</p>
<p>The one time we had the hotel in Namche do our laundry, it took two
days to get it back due to a power outage. It did return very clean,
though, and the price for the service was quite reasonable.</p>
<h3 id="staying-warm">Staying warm</h3>
<p>It’s cold up there! Vlogs and blogs always feature people in puffers
shivering uncomfortably, but bloggers are bad about sharing the dates of
their treks. I figured many of these must have taken place in March or
October, which should be cold. May, on the other hand, is spring! Surely
it wouldn’t be cold then?</p>

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Walking above Namche to the Hillary
School on May 1st.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Well, early May is cold. We got snowed on TWICE.</p>
<p>Staying warm outside is a matter of gear, covered above. But what
about staying warm inside?</p>
<p>Bedrooms are freezing. We usually had electric bed warmers, but those
didn’t work the nights that Namche lost power. The beds have thick
blankets, so if you get into them warm, they’ll stay that way. But the
rooms themselves are COLD–a good motivation to dress quickly in the
morning.</p>
<p>The public rooms are heated by stoves, which are not always lit. We
spent lots of time at meals wearing down jackets over fleece. Several
light layers work well, especially because once the stoves get going,
the room can get uncomfortably hot.</p>
<p>I struggle to keep my feet warm. I brought down leg warmers, which I
wore almost all the time, including on the trail; down booties, which I
wore in bed; and sheepskin boots, which I wore instead of the provided
slippers in the lodges.</p>
<p>The cold never left us. I’d intended to leave most of my warm stuff
with Bala in Namche Bazaar on our way back to Lukla but ended up keeping
it til the very end simply because I needed it.</p>
<h3 id="is-it-scary">Is it scary?</h3>
<p>Before booking our trek, the first thing I asked Hunter at Wilderness
Travel was whether the EBC trail has much scary exposure. She assured me
that it doesn’t. She’d just hiked our route and it wasn’t scary at
all!</p>
<p>I didn’t entirely believe her. People who aren’t scared of heights
can’t identify the bits that will frighten those of us who are. There’s
a whole range of acrophobia, much of which can be very situational and
idiosyncratic.</p>
<p>I booked the trip anyway. Chris had always wanted to see Everest. I
figured I’d spend a certain amount of time terrified and would somehow
muscle through. The fact my skeleton isn’t still stuck on top of the
Sefinafurga in Switzerland is testament to the fact that I CAN get
through high passes without psychically combusting.</p>

<p>But it’s no fun to spend much of a vacation scared out of your wits.
My doom-scrolling through blogs describing scary trails didn’t increase
my confidence. I envisioned getting paralyzed halfway between Pangboche
and Phortse, unable to move forward. I imagined having to revise our
entire itinerary to stick to the trails I was capable of walking.</p>
<p>That was all a waste of time.</p>
<p>The truth is, I was never scared of heights in Nepal. It wasn’t
nearly as scary as many sections of the Haute Route or the Via Alpina in
Switzerland, and certainly not as scary as the most exposed trails in
Crete.</p>
<p>Part of this was down to width. Like many people who fear exposure, I
struggle most with narrowness, which forces one to walk on an edge from
which it would be easy to imagine plunging. But if a trail is wide
enough, that edge feeling goes away. The trails in the Khumbu are the
region’s highway system, built for trains of pack animals and people who
use them for their weekly commutes. They are almost always wide enough
for two people to walk abreast.</p>
<p>The trails are also of high quality. Another thing that terrifies me
is walking on narrow, dusty trails that are slanted downhill. This isn’t
completely irrational; it’s very easy for a foot to slide on dust and
loose gravel. But the trails in the Khumbu are well maintained, often
paved with large stones. We didn’t walk on very much that was both steep
and slippery.</p>
<p>Then there was Bala Bai, our guide. I told him up front that I don’t
like exposed heights. He assured me that this wouldn’t be a problem.
This was in part clever guest management; he did keep one announcement
of an upcoming scary bit back until the last possible moment, though it
turned out that even that section of trail had just been rebuilt. But
there’s also the possibility that I was so focused on not embarrassing
myself by not inconveniencing Bala that I failed to register anything
that might have scared me if we’d been hiking alone. I don’t think so,
but this can’t be ruled out.</p>
<p>In any case, for anyone worried about acrophobia, I at least never
noticed edges.</p>
<p>Suspension bridges are another issue. I didn’t expect to be scared of
them and I wasn’t. Many people, however, do struggle with these things,
and they are unavoidable. YMMV.</p>
<h3 id="is-it-hard">Is it hard?</h3>
<p>Yes. The Everest Base Camp trail is hard. It’s about Tour de Mont
Blanc or Via Alpina difficulty–the shorter daily distances are canceled
out by the thinner air.</p>
<p>You have to climb. All the time. Everything is uphill, it seems. Just
walking around Namche Bazaar is strenuous exercise.</p>

<p>The trails are good and well-maintained, but they are rough and
rugged too. You have to watch every step.</p>
<p>But mainly, it’s very hard to walk for long hours and to climb
thousands of meters a day at low oxygen levels. We trained as much as we
could, but we had no realistic way to prepare for thinner air. (It’s
possible to train for altitude, as our xenon Everest summiters
demonstrated, but that requires a serious commitment to sleeping in a
hypoxia tent for months and otherwise using gear to restrict
oxygen.)</p>
<p>Fatigue can build up. By the time we got to Pangboche and Phortse, I
craved rest and tried to lie down and/or sleep whenever I could. Even on
our “luxury” trip, we got worn out.</p>
<h3 id="water">Water</h3>
<p>We drank a lot of water. A LOT of water!</p>
<p>It’s a tenet of high-altitude travel that dehydration increases the
risk of altitude sickness. Whether this really means people need to
drink ten liters of water a day, or that just makes everyone need to
pee, I don’t know, but we weren’t taking any chances. Bala certainly
wasn’t.</p>
<p>The water out of the taps isn’t safe to drink, so all the lodges
provide jugs of hot water in the rooms. We drank hot water with
meals–it’s considered beneficial for the health.</p>
<figure>
<img alt="Even with our elegant “Yeti Punch”, we always had hot water. Lots of hot water." src="/assets/images/03 Nepal/00 Introduction &amp; Training/ip16-IMG_7207.heic"/>
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Even with our elegant “Yeti Punch”, we
always had hot water. Lots of hot water.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Every morning, I mixed a packet of LMNT chili lime electrolyte powder
in a one-liter Nalgene bottle and drank it with my creatine pills before
leaving the room. (The creatine was meant to enhance performance on the
trail. It might have been responsible for our severely chapped lips that
developed late in the trek, so I’m not sure it’s the best idea.)</p>
<p>At breakfast, we drank several cups of tea and/or coffee, along with
the ubiquitous hot water. Bala would fill our blivets and Nalgenes
before we left, and he made sure we drank regularly along the trail.</p>
<p>We didn’t get altitude sickness, so I guess it worked. But the
subject of hydration leads me to another, related topic.</p>
<h3 id="toilets-town-and-trail">Toilets, town and trail</h3>
<p>TLDR: Bring packs of tissues and wipes.</p>
<p>Toilets. Yes.</p>
<p>So, the mountain lodges have fine western toilets in the lobbies and
in the rooms. They aren’t meant to take toilet paper, so the proper
behavior is to throw paper in the trash can. It’s only gross at first;
you get used to it pretty quickly. (Greece is like that too.) Also,
“flushable” wipes should never be flushed anyway.</p>
<p>We have no pictures for this section.</p>
<p>Restaurants and more basic lodges typically have squatty potties.
Some of these are primitive indeed; occasionally you find one with a
pile of pine needles next to a hole in a wooden platform, meant to cover
droppings that can then be used as fertilizer. Others have a barrel of
water with a pitcher in them, which you use to flush by hand.</p>
<p>On the trail itself, toilets were sometimes a challenge. Much of the
trail is very populated, and Bala could get us permission to use the
toilets at various teahouses. There are some public toilets; sometimes
there’s one you have to pay to use, and a more primitive (or filthy)
free one. The wipes are especially handy for cleaning one’s hands after
these places.</p>
<p>In less-developed areas, we looked for convenient trees or rocks.
These trails are very busy, so it was sometimes hard to find a place
with the requisite privacy.</p>
<p>We drank so much, sometimes it seemed that we were like dogs or cats,
marking our territory all the way up and down Ama Dablam.</p>
<h3 id="money">Money</h3>
<p>On the trek, most of our expenses were pre-paid, but we had to pay
for any extras like drinks, laundry, snacks, and wifi in some
places.</p>
<p>Some lodges will take credit cards, but card readers don’t work
without electricity.</p>
<p>We ran out of Nepali money buying expensive Sherpa-brand t-shirts and
gifts in Namche Bazaar (using cash because the power was out), and we
couldn’t get more before leaving Namche (because the power was out). We
got by with a combination of credit cards when possible and American
cash. Using dollars isn’t a problem.</p>
<p>There really isn’t that much to spend money on, and we didn’t want to
add to either our own loads or to our porter’s.</p>
<h3 id="connectivity">Connectivity</h3>
<p>Connectivity was almost never a problem. We had good signal nearly
everywhere, and since we weren’t downloading movies or whatever people
are doing now, we didn’t spend a fortune on it.</p>
<p>Everyone in the Khumbu has a phone and is in constant contact with
their people.</p>
<p>The lodges had wifi, but wifi only works when the electricity is on.
The mountain lodges provide free wifi. Other places will sell a wifi
card; those systems provide varying degrees of actual connection. We
paid for a card in Pangboche that we probably needn’t have, because
signal worked just as well.</p>
<h3 id="power">Power</h3>
<p>TLDR: Bring some batteries. Not too many.</p>
<p>For the most part, charging our phones and ipads wasn’t a problem.
(Laptops stayed in Kathmandu. Really, no porter should have to carry a
laptop, and a trekker shouldn’t take on the extra weight either.)</p>
<p>We could even plug in our chargers straight into the outlets. They
fit US plugs. We’d brought adapters with us, but they were unnecessary
in Nepal.</p>
<p>The problem was… the power went out for three days in the Namche
region. This sort of thing is unpredictable but maybe also inevitable.
So it was a good thing Chris had packed several batteries, including
some solar-powered ones. (Solar-powered battery technology might not be
all there yet; they just took too long to charge to be worth carrying.
Bala has those now.)</p>

<p>But we didn’t need all the batteries he brought to Nepal. The night
before we left Kathmandu, we concluded that the biggest and heaviest
ones just wouldn’t fit in the luggage (15 kg weight limits for ALL
luggage, including daypacks), so they stayed behind to keep the laptops
company.</p>
